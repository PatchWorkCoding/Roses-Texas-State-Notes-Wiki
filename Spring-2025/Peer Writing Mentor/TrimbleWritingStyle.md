Like pretty much all proffessions writers have a "sense" a learned thought proccess that overtime becomes second nature to the point where you forget you are even doing it at all

On aspect of this writing sense that novices often haven't developed is the idea that your words are ultimately for someone else. You need to think of your reader and how they might interpret what you have put on the page. This lack of reader awareness leads ultimately to sloppy writing, formatting like footnotes, page numbers, and paragraph breaks are added only because they are expected of you by a teacher not because of what they convey

The author refers to this concept of writing without the reader in mind "unconscious writing".

So writing is a form of communication where you are trying to convey infromation to the reader and elicit a response from them. Not only do you want them to understand what you are saying but we want them to feel it. In the form of a persausive essay we want them to both understand our argument and nod along in agreement.

As you develope a sense of that relationship you'll realize that in order to sell a persausive idea you want the reader to view you as trustworthy which comes across in your word choices

Tips from the book of how to win over readers:

"The big question, then, is how to win readers? Here are four essentials:
1. Have something to say that’s worth their attention.
2. Be sold on its validity and importance yourself so you can pitch it with con-
viction.
3. Furnish strong arguments that are well supported with concrete proof.
4. Use confident language—vigorous verbs, strong nouns, and assertive
phrasing."

These last few paragraphs are writing about the fundemantal truth I've been holding in my heart for sometime now which is "it isn't enough to be correct, you must also be someone people want to listen to." 

How do you become someone people want to listen to? anyway you can!

"There are five specific ways you can serve your readers’ needs. Please
add them to the list of four essentials that I gave you a minute ago; and as
you read them, note how they apply to conversation as well as to writing:
1. Phrase your thoughts clearly so you're easy to follow.
2. Speak to the point so you don’t waste readers’ time.
3. Anticipate their reactions (boredom, confusion, fatigue, irritation).
4. Offer them variety and wit to lighten their work.
Talk to them in a warm, open manner instead of pontificating to them like
a know-it-all."

"I have never had much patience with the writers who claim from
the reader an effort to understand their meaning. You have only
to go to the great philosophers to see that it is possible to express
with lucidity the most subtle reflections. You may find it difficult
to understand the thought of Hume, and if you have no philo-
sophical training its implications will doubtless escape you; but
no one with any education at all can fail to understand exactly
what the meaning of each sentence is"

Be clear, you are already asking the reader to give you their time and attention don't make that ask even greater by asking them to decifer your text as well. 
"So every
sentence—yes, every sentence—receives a battery of challenges:
* “Am I droning here? Is she ready to silence me? Is there any way I can light-
en this up?”
* “How can I get her to see—to feel—the urgency of this point?”
* “Is the continuity silky here, or is fatigue blinding me to a bump?”
* “Might she welcome an analogy here, or is this abstract idea clear enough
on its own?”
* “Am I treating her as if she were an idiot?”
* “Is there any conceivable way this sentence might confuse her?”
* “Have I just used any of these words in previous sentences?”
* “Will this phrase strike her as pretentious? And, honestly, am I using it to im-
press her, or is this the only way I can express the thought cleanly?”
* “Will she get the nuance here, or had I better spell it out?”
* “Can she jump on me for verbosity here?”
* “Will she hear a strongly conversational, living voice coming through, or am
I beginning to sound like a book?"

At the end of the day do not be afraid to rewrite the whole thing, to make it clearer with a reader in mind. If you don't then your work can be worse than useless, it can be confusing and irrating to read. moreover if your work is merely boring then it has failed its job no matter how profound the prose it in are

How to get words onto pages is a very individualist activity that varies from writer to writer

That being said here are some general guidlines:

* pick something you are passionate about!
    * if you don't have something in mind go for a stroll and brood or pick someting you love and sings its praise for a few pages until find something interesting or pick something you hate and tear into it until you find out why it makes you feel this way. It can be love or hate or integuie but it does have to be passion

* Start Small
    * Once you find the topic you are passionate about, cut it down to a specific small size. It is better to start small and get bigger rather than start big and get overwhelmed.
    * Don't linger in the planning phase, You won't know truly how big or small your project is until you start it. Submerge yourself up to your knees in it and then you'll know where you stand. Don't be afraid to take a machette to your work if it is to big

* Stock pile data
    * while you are thinking about your work, milling it over and digesting it, cutting parts out and reworking flaws, you should also be looking for data. Facts, tid-bits, sources, quotes, and parrallels, and puzzlements

* Pose tough questions
    * In order to generate facts or interesting data points ask the tough questions an investigator would: when? where? why? who? and how?
    * one practical point the author gives is to use smaller paper because it forces you to be more concise and is less intimidating to read later
    * Make sure when you are noting that you aren't writing, summarize and paraphrase
    * There are two virtues to this approach one is that you will have a the outline of the paper already written with convinent place to expand out and fill int
    * The other is organizational, your notes should be easily retiverable and so the condensed thoughts or minuture arguments will be as well

* Get an organzining principle/thesis
    * once you have your data and your scope the centeral idea that your argument will orbit around or your main theme you will explore through the story should be deciced. You have all the facts what ties them together?
    * A good thesis should be a point you can argue. It doesn't have to be a "yes or no" questions but it should be a question. "Can we do this?" vs "Can't we do this?", "is this interesting/not interesting", etc.
    * you should have conviction to your writing so that people immediatly understand that the thesis is worth caring about, or at the very least they'll be interested as to why you care so much about this

* Imagine a good audience
    * while you are writingm, you should be imaging your reader. The way you imagine them of course will change how you write, if you believe them to be hostile then you'll be inherently more defensive. The author suggests you should imagine your reader as a companionable friend, someone you can be open and honest with and someone who appreciates directness. If you want to presaude a friend I find a kind conversation better than a hostile arugment.
    * This audience at somepoint of course needs to become an imaginary person, if you are stuck writing to the same professor forever you'll never break out of your MLA8 formating you were forced to do in highschool

* Freewrite a "zero draft"
    * Read over your notes and give yourself about 20 mintues to have a conversation with your paper about what you have learned. Start with "it seems to me that..." and just continue, don't pause for more than a second, and just keep typing. You'll find where the argument breaks down or doesn't work as you type. If you do get to the point where you are stuck, write those thoughts down to, you can work out why you are stuck on paper and see where you'll need to improve in the final draft

* Critique your draft
    * Take a long break, enough to divorce that person in paper from the one who wrote it, come back to it with an open heart and mind, and then critique the every living shit out of it!
    * Does the arguemnt make sense knowing what you know? did you forget a point you want to add? Do you even believe in your own thesis anymore? What do you like from this draft? are their sentences wort keeping? is your thesis something you want to alter now that you have articlatued everything clearer

* Free write again for 45 minutes
    * Now start on your first-ish draft with the same temporment that you took in the "zero draft". don't slow down during those 45 minutes. To slow down is to loose momentum and let the creatitivity die in your lungs

* Tinker to get the words right!
    * okay now you can start the standard revising proccess. write a draft now that the argument is in place, and don't be afraid to reorganize and rewrite paragraphs that do a diservice to your work
