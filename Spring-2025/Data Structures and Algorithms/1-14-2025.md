Notes for the First day of Data structures!

I should setup an automatic push for github that like pushes all changes up in my sleep or something like that

Also computer is prolly going to die so I'll take down anything important on my phone

If you miss a class you should be able to go to another section in order to catch up!

He is a new factually member who just started here

He is a research who is working on robotics specifically drones, next semester he is going to teach a class on robotics for seniors where you program one of the robot dogs

Everyone is talking about AI. Both here and Imagine in all my other classes

I really should start learning about Neural networks. And I mean custom ones not just chatgpt API class

Data structures is really important!

The reason they are important is because you'll know how to use the most efficient algorithm, this is where you go from writing scripts to writing serious in the paint code

Uh oh this might be yet another class where my brain freezes over

Nevermind I like this class!

There are many different ways of creating a dictionary

Doing a dictionary as std::pair<string, string> dict[100]; is slightly better because it is easy for outside programmer to expand on it, and if you want operate on key value pairs you can just edit the class instead of having to edit multiple arrays. there is also no way for the arrays to de-sync

There are many ways to do data structures and algorithms your job as a computer scientist is to know which one is most efficient for your problem.

The book is really not essential, even the professor hasn't read it all the way through

Come to the office hours if you want more challenging problems >:)

You need to do this!

Pre-class quizzes

Make sure to make your code readable

If your midterm exam is lower than t then you can retry it but you can't score higher than t

Go to office hour for harder challenges!! please!!

There is another Textbook called: "Introduction to Algorithms aka CLRS" by Thomas Cormen, Charles Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein.

Another boot to look at is "Data structures & Algorithms in C++" by Michael Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, David Mount

We are starting Second lecture

Abstraction - Problem solving on the general level. Making it agnostic to certain contexts

Problem Solving trough the use of a computer start by:
* Solving it Conceptual - use your brain to define your problem and think about how you will go about writing your code
* Programming it - implement your concept

Conceptual design should always come first. 

*Listen up Rose your inherent intuition will eventually fail you so start getting good at it now*

If you don't have time to do it right, you defiantly don't have time to do it over!
