1. Please define the minimal set of operations of the ADT of an integer array in c++. Please write down the preconditions of these operations:

*void SetArraySize(int size)*
* precondition: *size* is an integer larger than 0 and less than the maximum bound of an integer value 

*int GetItemAt(int index)*:
* precondition *index* is an integer from 0 to the max array size

*int SetItemAt(int index, int value)* 
* Precondition *index* is an integer from 0 to the max array size. And value is an integer 

2. Please write a C++ class based on the above ADT. please check the precondition using Assert().

Class IntegerArray {
    int[]

}
