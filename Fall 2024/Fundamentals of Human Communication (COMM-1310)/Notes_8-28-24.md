What is Competent Communication:
Anyone can do it and is listed with 3 criteria:
* Are you understood
* Does it Achieve the intended Effect
* Is it Ethical


Models of Communication:
* Action
* Interaction
* Transaction

The Communication as Action has 3 components:
* The Source - who is sending the message
* The Receiver - who is receives
* Channel - what is the medium it is being transmitted through
* Noise - any kind of distraction or unwanted data

(the problem with this model is that it doesn't allow for Receiver feedback)

The Communication as Interaction: It is the same as Action but with feedback (it is very linear)

The Communication as Transaction: Both parties are sources/receivers both providing messages and feedback to one another (it is most accurate to how we communicate in our day to day lives)

What are characteristics of Communication
* Inescapable communication - Basically any communication you can't escape
* Irreversible - You can't take the information back
* Complicated - Talking is hard (there are six of you when conversing)
* Content & relationships - What your saying and who you are saying it to
* Rule Governed - Communication has certain unsaid rules

The five Principles of Communication:
* Adapt
* Aware
* Verbal
* Nonverbal
* Listen and Respond

What is perception and why is it important

our perception is the arousal of our sense, it how we acquire new infromat and makesense of the would

Once our sense are activated we begin to process them

Our perceptions are influenced by our self-concept  and self-esteem

Self-concept is what you think about your self

Self-esteem is how you feel about your self-concept

Beauty is held in the eye of the beholder

all information is filtered through your perception

your perception is your reality

Stages of Perception:
* stage one: selection and attending - what happens when you first react to stimuli
* stage two: organization - pulls all the information you know about the stimuli
* stage three: interpretation - assign the meaning to the stimuli based on the information you gathered

How can we enhance our perceptual


How do you check your preception-check

Indirect perception checking - seeking out additional information to either confirm of refute our interpretations, Use passive techniques to gather information

Direct perception checking - Asking the personal directly whether your interpretation of what you perceive is correct, this process can also involve a third party
