So thoreau is talking about how  ridiculous the whole point of it all is. Humanity seems to have forgotten what is true, that the hunting and subsitance farming is what is good and natural, and has instead adopted these systems of currency and believed in them so heavily that they would dig in the ground to find shiny rocks so that they may "earn" the right to continue another day. And for what? those rocks won't feed you, you should spend your time doing things that really matter, and then spend the remaining time on things you want to do.

Spoken like a man who has never felt the systemic violence of poverty
