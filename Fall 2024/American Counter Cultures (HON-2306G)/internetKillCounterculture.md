Very interesting point up top! The internet is culture. It isn't just that it is another way to spread ideas like the phone or tv but instead it is a unique space with its own customs and rule. The internet is more akin to university campus, or library, club meeting place, coffee house, etc, than it is two single channel communications. Because of this if you want to be counter cultural then you can't meet in the places where that are owned by the mainstream.

Like abraham you have to go find a new space to build for yourself and your community. 

If you want your ideas to free flow it needs to exist out of these websites that have very strict content algorithms that make the mass dissemination of certain ideas really difficult

Counterculturalists can no longer shock audiences into self-reflection anymore because the internet can't be shocked?

which I don't think is the correct take because when shocking things happen, it is immediately analyzed under a hundred-thousand different sets of eyes, everyone has a take and they are all shouting their opinions very loudly. In the first hours of a controversy live-streamers are already formulating a take and updating it in real
time along with the 24-hour news cycles and people are posting there initial reaction all over twitter. in the next few days those lives streams are turned into video clips and other youtube channels who focus on content that ranges in 10 - 30 minute time intervals upload their own content on the platform. If a story is big enough then you will start getting drama recap videos at around the 1 to 2 week mark and finally if the story is huge a video essayist will cover the topic in a 4-hour video 2 - 3 months after the initial incident.

Tech companies were adopted originally as a consequence of free will. Most people used google because it was (at one point) the best search engine on the market. Because of this all of its competition went bankrupt and left google with all the power. but now there is no way for a competitor to take the crown because no one will fund a better alternative because they believe it is impossible to dethrone google, because there is no money companies have no power and if anyone tries to start on their own they will just get eaten by google, snapped up or forced to go bankrupt. and this lack of competition has also led google to just get worse and worse because who are you going to go to? 

If you want to try and beat the system you can't critique it from within because your morals will always be compromised by the fact that you can't up set the company to much or you will get booted off of it.

This is why a lot of gen-z slang was created was because of the external pressure TikTok put on creators to not say certain words. That's how we get "unalive" as a slang for death because you will get banned for talking about death. this cause langauge to evolve but idk if the langauge has been nurtured because fo this or if we have just created new words that can replace the original whole cloth


What the NSA did wasn't illegal. It is perfectly legal through the patriot act. Just because you find it morally wrong doesn't make it illegal. Tell it like it is, if you find it abhorrent that the government can make things you find immoral legal than I would like you to follow that feeling and see what you learn about power and how we let the government wield it

I like that observation that from a political standpoint we are no longer trying to "vote the bad people out of office" but instead salt the earth so that "the bad people can't get into power". We are changing focus from individuals to systems while perhaps not recognizing that systems are changed by individuals.

We can so easily dawn the extremely radical idealogies because we have opt-ed out of the idea that we can in fact change society on any level. We become "Communists" because it freaks out old people or makes us feel like we are part of revolutionary forces of by gone eras. It is an aspect of personal expression rather than a set of actions you plan to take in order to change the future

I think anonymity is generally more appreciated in far-right circles where as the left is more focused on action you have taken to make the world a better place. It is considered bad for you to be branded as a "larper" in left space, and respect is earned through actually taking action in the community. This is because you are leftist believe there ideals to be moral and justified where as far-right types are more insecure about what people think about their idealogy. the far-right is generally built in spaces like 4-chan where everyone is anonymous and common phrase you'll hear is people talking about "hiding their power level" which is a call to not be overtly fascist
