"The only obligation which I have a right

daily made the agents of injustice"

These two quotes sum up the fundamental difference I have with Thoreau, as well as Thoreau's main axiom. That systems themselves cannot have a morality, only the individual can be moral or immoral. So if a system is producing immoral actions that must mean that the people in control are immoral, or at least not moral enough.

Goods systems are necessarily run by good people. There is no universe

Civil disobedience is the bare minimum of what you can do for your conscious. If you can't take direct action on every cause you can take no action to help the causes you hate
