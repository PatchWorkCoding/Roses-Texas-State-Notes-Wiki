Fouriesists where coummunitrainists who wanted to bring about socialist like changes but through no violent means.

Fourier believed he had found a fundamental theory of human "passion" His communes weren't these ever evolving experiments but instead a demonstration of his scientific principle that he had discovered

Fourier also believed his change would be instantaneous rather than gradually over time.

There were Fourier experiments that setup in America and each one of them worked to great success for a time. But they were very delicate, at some point a disaster strikes and the whole thing falls apart. There is something that strains the social forces and eventually it snaps and everyone decides to go there separate ways.

So The Fourier communities really fell apart for the same reason. Everybody wasn't on board with the community. They were huddled into their own little family units with strict gender roles and religious beliefs. Not only would there be in fighting between the different social groups which makes the community foundation shake, when the time came for great hardship there wasn't enough by in to the community and so when the going got tough the people got going

Some people have fundamentally incompatible belief systems which if fine. people are allowed to have radically different beliefs but the hope is that a system designed to produce good could with stand these different beliefs which Fouriers couldn't.

If you want to build a community that lasts you have to do it slowly, glacially slowly. Because spontaneous actions don't last very long. And when we do see a spark that ignites a huge fire we tend to forget all the kindling and fuel that was already built up by hundreds of people over many many years.
