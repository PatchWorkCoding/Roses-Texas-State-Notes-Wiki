That is an interesting question Watts, idk what would be taboo in todays cultures, maybe it would be to discuss matters of politics. To try discuss how things aught to be instead of how things are. Most of my humor and general operation in the world is to point and laugh at taboos, to take what was once of limits and dance around where it like a costume in order to point out the ridiculousness of it.

Ooooohhhhh so that is what absurdism is! this feeling to bring to the world that what is on the surface patiently arbitrary and futile is instead fascinatingly strange. Come into the arbitrary not with sadness that it has no point but instead with wonder as to why it has this point. Like Mathew Sorenson (or more accurately Prinasi) you purpose is to study the house rather than to know the house

That's a fun argument! They idea that we should dismiss the big fundamental questions because they have no practical purpose. Does it really matter if the universe was created by God, or a simulation, or just a weird quirk of physics, when I still gotta pay my taxes?

*"I, myself" is a separate center of feeling an action, living inside and bounded by the physical bodyâ€”a center which "confronts" an "external" world of people and things, making contact through the senses with a universe both alien and strange. Everyday figures of speech reflect this illusion. "I came into this world." "You must face reality." "The conquest of nature."*

You are not a separate entity from the universe

*As the ocean "waves," the universe "peoples."*

*like our eyes, will bring the most distant objects into our own brains.*

It is hard to define the truth of the universe because in order to do so you must describe the truth of yourself because in order to full understand the universe you must understand yourself because you are an aspect of it. The reason it is so hard to define yourself is because you are trying to describe a cause through the affect. You are trying to describe what color a mirror is by describe the colors reflected in the mirror. Sure the mirror is the color of your eyes now but that is because you are looking at it.

God playing hide and seek is a fun metaphor! although it brings a certain person-hood to the universe that I am generally not a fan of. This is more of a personal taste thing and not a serious critique.

Why not use it for god? if there is no outside and no inside then it is perfectly reasonable as there is no alive and dead.

Is religion the practice of define the world, or how you should live? The intuitive answer would be that the latter flows from the former. That once you understand how the universe works you will then understand how to live in it. But the more I think on it the more I find those to ideas to be radically disconnected.
