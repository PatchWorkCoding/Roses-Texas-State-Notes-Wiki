So the author identifies the current prevailing evil of society is that Labor is no longer fulfilling and in some cases harmful to the soul

America has been incredible industrial innovation but has not had any incredible social change. The people want social change to come from a "great man" but the author pushes back on that idea

There is absoultely zero momentum or conceptualization by the general public of a "better future".

The author defines Civilization as "The current social system in which we live" Basically civilization as we would use it today rather than it being used as "Civilization" as in civilized

Civilizee - a civilized citizen

Incoherent - basically ridiculous 

These argument reminds me a lot of emerson. Work is where we derive our meaning and so the work we are doing today provides little meaning to us and in fact degrades our souls

All labor should be considered good but that labor which dengrades the soul show be considered bad

We need to see labor as good so that the rich want to do it...? that circle doesn't quite square my friend

Mmmm don't love the child labor argument

I guess this is the enlightenment for you. They try to build "scientific" understandings of the universe by finding "inherent qualities of the universe" and then exploiting them for the good of all man kind. Which works when you are talking about steam engines and lightening rods but really breaks down when talking about the nature of human beings. because we change where as the laws of nature don't

What a wild fucking chapter. Okay so the idea is this: there are four cardinal passion that need to be kept in harmony. If they don't there will be disputes among the people which will end up reforming the class structure. In order to preserve these Harmonies children need to work all the dirty and disgusting jobs so that they may learn all the importance of friendship which they will carry with them in order to love the community

Basically Fourier identifies correctly the problem in modern society the destruction of the soul through cruel and unfair labor, but instead of despising the class system that brings about such inequalities he instead thinks the world will get better if we can all just get along more.

I guess we can't all be marx *sigh*

Okay maybe Fourier does dislike the class system. But it feels like he more despises *this* class system rather than class systems as a whole
