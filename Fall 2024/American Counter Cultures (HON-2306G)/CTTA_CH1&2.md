So Timothy Leary in the forward of this book proposes a definition for counter culture that is less about the time, place, or prevailing idea of the 60s era movement but instead defines counter culture as those on the front lines of culture. living lives outside of the normal and sometimes dragging culture forward by its hair. Basically it can be thought of as pioneer's of culture.

This definition is interesting and makes for a good forward because it gets the audience thinking about what culture is and how we can go about changing it.

Counterculture by this definition is not a static idea but is instead it is a name for the fringe where new cultures (or more accurately augmented versions of the current culture) are tested, revised, adopted, dropped, and reworked until something stable comes out that the rest of society will adopt.

Leary also makes an important distinction that countercultures are not by the nature radically political or extremist, although you will find counterculturalists in extremist groups. The way I can square this circle is that while counterculturalists are creating new and radical ways of creating culture they are not primarily interested in changing the current culture to fit their new constructions where as political radicals are.

okay so the author argues that counterculturalists in addition to desiring to find new and interesting modalities of being also want to make sure that future generations have the same if not more freedom allotted to them to make there own cultures. They do not desire to make a new culture manifest rather to have the ability to make new cultures over and over again.

"Rather, countercultures seek primarily to live with as
much freedom from constraints on individual creative will as possible,
wherever and however it is possible to do so. And when people exercise this
kind of freedom with commitment and vigor, they unblock the light so
that subsequent generations may bask in its glow."

"I deliberately chose to break with traditions in order to
be more true to Tradition than current conventions and
ideas would permit."
Meaning that in order to get back to the really important part of a tradition sometimes it is necessary to shed all the frivolous parts of that tradition that have built up over time. This is really hard to do however as people will react very negatively to those changes (in some cases even killing you for it). However this great personal risk to any individual wishing to bring about a new idea is a necessary evil because changes to such fundamental cultural ideals should be met with just as grave consequences

Countercultures are measured by how widely their traditions are adopt but as we just discussed the tradition isn't whats important rather it is truth behind those tradition that is. When we adopt these traditions we severe them from their historical contexts and so it is only through looking backward at history with a lense for counterculture that we can find the truth behind these traditions

Direct Contact - when one counterculture directly adapts key truths from another counterculture by having direct face-to-face exchanges of ideas

Indirect Contact - when one counterculture adapts the traditions of another through studying there art, texts, or other "mediated" forms of communication

Resonance - When similar ideas appear in very disparate or separated countercultures because the ideas resonated with in both groups

"Although revolutionary novelty in art, thinking, or spirituality turns out
more often than not to have arisen from a countercultural milieu, bold
innovation—no matter how contrary to the status quo—does not itself a
counterculture make. Authentic counterculture is driven by an impulse
even deeper than the desire to innovate or to overturn conventions.
Counterculture cannot be crafted or produced: it must be lived."

Culture is not a set of traditions, aesthetics, or beliefs; it is a way one lives there life and views the world. It is the sum greater than its individual parts

"and as for you, dear reader? I can only humbly request that, as you
enter this historical narrative, you leave your expectations at the door. You
can pick them up unaffected, if you wish, at the end of the trip."

"when it comes to gender pronouns like “his” or “her,” I like to just mix them up. Some-
times I'll refer to the generic person in the masculine and sometimes in the
feminine. Get over it."

Martin Luther King! Are you fucking with me? accepting our lot in life juxtaposed with MLK is a real slap in the fucking face. MLK was so against the status quo him and the whole civil rights movement put fucking acts into law into law. Jesus was so revolutionary he started a god damn religion and was crucified for it. Socrates tried to enlighten people and asked question of authority and again was killed for it. Accepting their lot my ass!

So countercultures can be split along two different lines. The Promethean and Anti-Promethean. The Promethean are for technology and technological innovation and see it as key to building new cultures. They see it as transcending the old and bitting the thumb in the face of divinely appointed rules (traditions). The Anti-Promethean are against this technological progress and want to return to truths they think were lost in the old traditions.

It did democratize communication or at the very least it still has the ability to democratize communication, right now it is kind of a anarcho-capitalist hodge-podge of 6 different websites and AWS being a corporate back bone

Anti-Promethean still contain in them the Promethean Spirit because they want to use technology to liberate them from the mainstream, the just don't want to be slaves to it.

Abraham embodies an important part of the counterculture because he is a self-inflicted outcast who built his own society on the fringes of his current society.

The author is currently saying that Abraham's monotheism was a new kind of totalitarianism (and so anti counterculture.) I agree with the author here but I think it is more illuminating if you look at abraham and his god as sort of the point where counterculture turns into a religious practice.
