The "Oversoul" as Emerson calls it is sort of equivalent to the hippies radical love. It is the recognition that we are all part of some great and powerful one. That we are the universe experiencing itself and more importantly that we are together as expressions of the same singular thing. each of our souls is part of the great "oversoul" and in that soul we are one. We are derived from it we are *it*

"that is, as there is no screen or ceiling between our heads and the infinite heavens, so is there no bar or wall in the soul where man, the effect, ceases, and God, the cause, begins."
 
Emerson argues that time and the passage of it as measured by the clock is less real than our perceptions of time. If we experience the divine as an intimate thing or more accurately if we are part of the oversoul directly descended from the divine then our senses or perception of reality is the Truth.

We can feel this undefinable human oneness in the quite moments between to friends, and sometimes even between strangers

real recognize real

A revelation is real just a realization made by oversoul. It is an understanding that rings true because the soul recognizes it to be such

Truth and understanding lay in the experiencing of a thing and not in the hearing about of a thing

If it was meant to happen it'll happen

Every poet is really just having the same revelations over and over again. (I agree with this one less because we have changed rather significantly in the past 100 years to the point that it feels like we can have new revelations about fundamental human truths that one could not observe in prior ages)

If the oversoul is Truth and Truth is something that must be subjectively preserved then don't let other people tell you what you feel. You must feel it yourself
