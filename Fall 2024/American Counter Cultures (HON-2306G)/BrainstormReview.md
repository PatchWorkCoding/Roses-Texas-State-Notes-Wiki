The topic I think needs to be a little broad, you might need to narrow it to either a specific deep aspect of the culture like the houses. You don't want to fall into the trap of writing ten pages just on the description of one aspect of the culture.
The Puzzle ins interesting in

The puzzle is really good! and the topic is really good, but I think you need to have a more concrete take. I think there is a lot of ground that can be discussed about how these practice of car modification as a form of self expression have been criminalized or at least looked down upon by society. How do the people in power get away with it, how does the community fight back against those stereotypes. Mainly just having a clear take will help you find your way through the sheer amount of stuff you could talk about as far Chicano's go

There was also the very large "Vaccines cause autism" scare they kept it alive through most of the 2000s and 2010s, I would highly recommend watching the  H.Bomberguy video essay because it is highly entertaining and extraordinary informative on the anti vax movement through that time

There has gotta be an RFK Jr. mention as he is going to be appointed head of the CDC

I love the take! I think talking about how Antivaxxer's use internet to broadcast there message and how their present erods trust in the government

There is an Essay by philosophy tube about "what an expert is supposed to look like". that I think would be interesting to look at
