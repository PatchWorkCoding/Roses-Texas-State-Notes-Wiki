Okay so the author makes the argument that you can split a subculture into two different forms. Firstly is the commodity form which encompasses the styles, the music, and the goods consumed by that subculture. You aren't a true punk unless you were docks and listen to the sex pistols.

The second form is the ideological form and is more concerned about how the group is re-labeled by the outside world. How are you viewed by those in power

"Youth cultural styles may begin by issuing symbolic challenges, but they must inevitably end by establishing new sets of conventions; by creating new commodities, new industries or rejuvenating old ones"

"They are seen to contain both dangerous aliens and boisterous kids, wild animals and wayward pets."

When the mainstream is meet with the ideological form of a subculture it handles it in two ways. It either downplays making the differences into similarities or it makes the difference spectacular turning the average into a spectacle not worth analysis just gawking. There exist both dangerous aliens and boisterous kids but never something in the middle, never a reasonable person with persuasive views

Style in the subculture is meant to draw attention to the subject where as style in the mainstream is meant to draw as little attention to it as possible

Bricolage: "Levi-Strauss shows how the magical modes utilized by primitive Peoples (superstition, sorcery, myth) can be seen as implicitly coherent, though explicitly bewildering, systems of connection between things which perfectly equip their users to ‘think’ their own world. These magical systems of connection have a Common feature: they are capable of infinite extension because basic elements can be used in a variety of improvised combinations to generate new meanings within em,"

In a way a Bricolage is like an ideology but more expansive, it is a set of all axioms that members of the group use to define the world. The same way that when you talk to zealot all their answer will come back around to god.
