This article is super interesting! because I kind of agree, I think punk is probably the gradiation point between what a subculture was, we are all going to dress up and believe the same things and *live* this moment into what a social movement is today which is... more complicated. (These are all my opening theories however)

Alright article start: The author makes the point that back in the 1970s the idea of subculture consisted of many people all acting, talking, and/or dressing the same in order to broadcast a wider message. 

The author goes on to explain that these subcultures where great vehicles for social change because of their transgressionory tactics. They perpetuated themselves and broadcasted there messages through shock-and-aw. That strategy no longer works however because we aren't shocked in the same ways anymore. 

So now we enter the Punk scene, a transgressive force for social change transgressing against transgressive subcultures themselves by transgressing all the way up to 11

However it was still caged in the same way and died the same way that all subcultures due. It became part of nostalgia, and nostalgia at the end of the day is a marketing ploy used to sale consumer defanged images of the past. selling them a time when they felt radical to a time where the no longer want to be radical.

Now all of our subcultures are like this you can by them off the rack for $10.99 and where them for a few years and then drop them. I had a "goth phase" means that you wore your hair in a certain way and maybe adopted a few different attitudes but it wasn't like a real social movement. and of course everyone has a "goth phase" and because everyone has it, it can no longer be transgressive 

The early punks where easily adopted into consumerism because the way they transgressed the mainstream was by specifically consuming things that we "Taboo". These punks should capitalist that there was a market for "taboo" and so it was packaged up and sold off. The store making work boots for dock workers become a high end fashion brand over night

"Long after the ‘death’ of classical punk, post-punk and/or punk subcultures coalesce around praxis. For contemporary punks subcultural membership, authenticity, and prestige are transacted through action internal to the subculture."

So thats the scoop: the bands, the clothing, the symbolism that signifies your allegiance to a subculture or group was tossed out as it was too easily commodified and adopted and would strip the movement of its political message. Thus we adopt punk idealogies but namelessly and facelessly. The message lives on even after the messaging has died
