People take drugs generally because of the societal views on drugs.

I don't quite agree with that, we aws a society became hyper-critical of drug user but people still did drugs.

Ah as I thought I was being a bit hairpin there. People in subcultures tend to do drugs based on those subcultural values, these subcultures are also in a byproduct of mainstream culture

There is a difference between luxury and play. Luxury is all based around consumption and it fits nicely in the "work hard to make money and then you spend money to feel good" model. Notice there is no service paid to whether or not there can be an activity that makes you feel good and doesn't require money.
