This article and the article called "the internet didn't kill counterculture" kind of strike at the same idea of "political idealogy repackaged and resold as personal identity" Capitalism and Hegemonic powers as a whole take dissent and change it from something political into something personal. From an action into an opinion, from something achievable to something aspirational. Through that lens any idealogy becomes declawed as no one really takes seriously the idea that they can change the world.
