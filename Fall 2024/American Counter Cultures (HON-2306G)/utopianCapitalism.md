So Kerista is a commune that did integrate itself with larger society by participating in the capitalist economy

Honestly the branding of "Utopian Capitalism" seems misguided when at least right now they are describing market socialism

Okay so it is more like a commune because everyone lives together and shares resources but it is more stable than the average commune because there is an element of market participation. They all pool there resources in many different ways in order to make more profit and perpetuating the business side.

I think it is interesting because the community nature tends to dampen the capitalist instinct to gain as much wealth and power as possible because you want to do what is best by everyone not just yourself. I still think that they are just adopting socialistic and communistic principles and then putting a capitalist spin on them because "socialis"m is a big scary word. But I mean whatever gets the principles enacted I guess

I think there is an interesting psychology to look at here when it comes to money. We have this idea that everyone sees money in an "Objective" sense. We all have an idea of the exact number in our bank account and me make descisions based on that number, and more importantly if we feel like something has been taken from us when we spend that money. But in Kerstia you just give that money willing to the community, there isn't a second thought. 

I guess what I am trying to say is money in that system is no longer valuable because the ways we derive value from cash is what it can get us but past a certain point where all of your basic needs are met, the rest of the money kind of just turns into useless numbers going up and down.

They highlight a very important principle here: that two people can live more cheaply than one and three people can live more cheaply than two. That is to say work at scale is non-linear in most cases, When tending to a 40 people you might only need 5 to do the dishes and maybe 5 to cook which leaves the other 30 to add value in new creative ways such as keeping the business afloat or entertaining each other, or relaxing so they can do more efficient work later.

When you are by yourself you need to cook, and do the dishes, and work, and rest, and there is only a limited set of hours in the day. 

And thats how the story goes Capitalism eats communalism. The social fabric is stressed by outside pressures as the commune seeks to accumulate more power. As power increase so  do the social pressures until the fabric snaps and everyone gets taken down. That is why the communes of the 60s failed and that is why change can't happen from the ground up. You have to change the material reality in order to get the commune to thrive.
