# So here is the story
My main man Victor Prosper Considerant is living in france and he is trying to get a socialist commune started

However he is kicked out of France by napoleon after he critized how badly napoleon was running the country

So he flees to America and winds up in Texas along the trinity river just outside of Dallas

Once he starts setting up he writes a book called "To Texas" which gets translated to german and english and it invites everyone to come on down and help him get this new little society going

So now an estimated 400 people from all over show up with there wagons to the site of Reunion and find... Nothing. Considerant has scammed the shit out of them

In to deep and not to be deterred they got to work trying to make even a little something out of the nothing they had. Which they did, they built large central structures and rough hewn living quarters and for a time they were happy.

And then it came for them, the same thing that comes for all communes, Money troubles and a recreation of the class system

The peoples trust in Considerant started to dwindle after, you k'now, he had lied to them all. So in order to regain power he started become more and more of an autocrat. (*Which marx would total have loved*)

Considerant fell into a depression of whisky and morphine and kept spending time further and further away from the Colony. In his abscence a power vacuum formed and now everyone is at each others throats. (*I can already tell that this ends, high tensions leads to breakdowns in communication which leads to the desctruction of the commune because communes rely on strong social cohesion and will fail without it*)

Okay so the army doctor shows up near end of the commune and he acts as the catalyst that brings the whole thing down. He starts questions Considerants authority and starts sowing division through out the community.

On top of this there all exsited outside social pressures from the newspapers who kept calling the new commune a group of socialist who were coming to destroy your way of life and take away all the vital institutions you hold dear. 

The Texas state legislator didn't help either rejecting Considerants efforts to either get the territory incorporated or get the legislator to pay commune for the efforts they had put in to settling the land

Eventually Considerant got tired enough to want to stop fighting the government, the newspaper, and his own people.

He released a pamphlet called "From Texas" where blames just about everyone but himself for the down fall of the commune.

In the end after Considerant left, the colony fell apart due to the same problems as always, They didn't have enough marketable skills to participate in the larger capitalist economic community and so ran up debts the couldn't pay. These debts where exacerbated by unforeseen weather conditions and other geological disaster lead to the colony defaulting and then being swallowed up by there neighbor

Even though it failed La reunion's residents where able to ingratiate themselves with Dallas and through marriages and friends ships the two communities grew close

However the war came and some of the citizens of the commune went out to fight, They weren't abolitionists after all and so went to fight with the confederacy

Some of the older citizens were routinely harassed by Confederate soliders

There is one story of the confederates trying to takeaway the guns of the La reunion and so the citizens held up in a story house and pointed 2 - 3 guns for each man out the window which led the confederates to think there were more people than there actually were

Eventually through dispersion the former citizen of La Reunion had significant impacts in their own way on the formation of the Dallas we know today.

However Dallas has let this history slip into complete disrepair and does nothing to remember its name. Just like a lot of americas leftist roots
