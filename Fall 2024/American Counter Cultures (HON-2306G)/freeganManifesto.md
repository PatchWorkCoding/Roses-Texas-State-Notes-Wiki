Freegan is a food ethic that is anti-consumerism

For those just joining us an Ethic is defined as: A set of moral principles, especially ones relating to or affirming a specified group, field, or form of conduct. (taking from googles dictionary autofill)

A summary of a summary to discuss why the author feels the need to create an anti consumerist food ethic:
* Treading Lightly on the Earth: A lit of our pollution and waste byproducts come directly from the process of making and distrusting food. One of the ways the author illustrates this points is by telling reader to look into there trash cans and realize just how much of that garbage came from food packaging
    * I would argue that the reason for that is because food is one of those resources that must necessarily be consumed and then its packaging thrown away. You could bundle food together in a microwave dinner fashion where a wider variety of food comes in a smaller box but at the end of the day unless you live on a farm there is no way to eliminate the vast majority of that waste. I imagine that the author will go on to explain why we should all go live on farms...
* Anti-capitalism: to be anti-consumer is in part to be anti capitalism. What better way to fight the man than not buying his goods
* Working Sucks: *no notes pretty straight forward*
*  Privilege: We in america have so much while everyone else has so little. A way to fight this injustice is to recuse yourself from the whole system entirely
    * ah yes the best way to fucking kill a political movement. God I know this is just a sign of the time but I am so fucking sick of individualistic solutions to systemic problems. All that disengaging from the system does is let you jerk your self off about how morally justified you are. Without wider political adoption there is no power in disengaging, all your doing is driving people with power away from the movement and surrounding yourself with those who are equally as disenfranchised as yourself. "I know y'all love to see the way the failure flounders maybe I can be your daily downer." -Aesop Rock.
    Oh also its pretty fucking presumptuous to to assume that everyone can adopt the same lifestyle as you. when so many other factors feed into how you can live besides food.
* The ultimate boycott: see rant above about why disengaging is pointless
* Your Life: Here the author ask the reader to reflect on how capitalism has fucked them over and how trapped they are in the system. It is pretty box standard stuff when talking about the political landscape of 2024

Ultimately the authors pitch is the same as most religious thought leaders. Come join us and you'll be able to heal your heart form the sin of the world. Politics as a life style brand rather than a set of action to undertake to see change in the world

The author goes on to critique veganism calling it a half-measure. Basically they see veganism as a boycott of corporations who harm animals by using animal products in there productions. The authors critique is that this boycott only takes into consideration animal rights where as Freegans seek to boycott all injustice by limiting there consumerist footprint as much as possible

So freegans basically take veganism on step further by disengaging with the consumerist machine entirely and instead try to find there food for as little money as possible, hopefully eating only free meals. This is done by subsuming off the copious excess of our ineffecent food production

The two main points of the How to freegan are:
* Quality of Food: Same as what I was saying earlier basically try to reduce the amount of spending on food to as little as possible. The gold standard would be to get everything for free in whatever way you can. There is this concept of "edgy" foods which are foods on the edge of edibility
* Quantity of Food: basically our food production creates a lot of excess food nobody eats so there is a lot to have if you know where to find it


Now the author goes into the different strategies of Freeganism:
* Dumpster Diving: You know its the classic open up a dumpster and see what goodies you can find. The author also goes on to talk about how you should fuck up trash compactors because they are instruments of big business to stop people from scavenging around
    * Under a certain light I get what they are saying because if that stuff is going to a landfill anyway then why not let everybody go through it and pick out stuff they might find valuable. But trash compactors aren't security implements there objects to help move vast quantities of garbage from one place to another. Sure it might not be good that big stores produce so much waste but even if they did produce less they would probably still need a compactor because they will nesseceraliy create more waste than most businesses 
* Give-Aways: Take from food banks that might have extra stock
* Plate scraping/Table-Diving: Go eat the scraps of someone elses plate once they are done using them
* Wild foraging/Gardening: Take whatever food you can find in the wild, either from naturally edible plants growing in back lots to straight up stealing from farms you live close to. You could also garden either on your own lot of land or just someone else.
* Barter: create small communities to help distribute the finds out of dumpster and the like, either through trading or just redistribution
* Scams/Shoplifting: Theft, just straight unapologetic theft. let your conscience guide you (i.e. fuck the will of the people use your own morals)
* Shoplifting: This one is also just theft, but the morality behind it is more explained. The idea is to steal from a big business and the debate is not over whether the theft is ethical but whether you stealing it just creates an empty shelf that someone has to then go and fill which will cause the store to create more waste. They also discuss an idea of "hyperboycott" which is where you don't stop at not buying something but you instead go out and steal the product from shelves to trash it so  that corporations learn that it is hostile for them to stock it
* Employee Theft: If you are employed by a company then steal from them. Boss makes a nickle I make a dime. Or if you know for a fact that something is going to get thrown out but it is ultimately still good then you can just take it instead and use it.
* Returns: Find items that where thrown out or someone abandoned, pretened you bought those items and return it to the store to get money or store credit

Extending the Ethic - heres how to take everything one step further than just food
* Energy: Use solar energy, make solar ovens, hand dry clothes, don't us HVAC systems when you could just layer up, Hand wash dishes (This one is actually bad, dishwashers are way more efficient), turn off lights when you aren't using them, etc
* Water: Don't use excess water by showering with a friend or use the toliet as little as possible (i.e. don't flush when you pee only when you poop, or use adult diapers you found in the dumpster)
* Car-lessness: Use public transition or at the very least carpool
* Homebrew: Brew your own alcohol
* Get a Cup: Bring a cup and other reuseable utensils with you in order to minimize waste. I try to do this already by reusing disposable water bottles, and bringing my own therms
* Get a Hanky: same with the cup but this time its a napkin
* Squat: just live in an abandoned building for fre
* Stretch: Take what you have an make it last by fixing it, borrowing it, or finding it for free. Ask yourself if you really need it or can do without. by things second hand, etc.  This is again something I already do on certain levels, and something I am trying to do more.

Conclusion: I can't get behind the ethic or the message but I can get behind some of the sentiment. I think we all should encourage self-reliance and reusability. Minimizing waste is a good idea and finding better ways that we as individuals can minimize was is also good idea. Finding better deals on food, eating slightly stale bread, reusing certain types of food like stale bread in order to make french toast etc are all amazing practices. I think my main issue with the movement is that it is hyperindividualistic. It ignores the fact that the world is a systemic being and instead sees it as a static object. The movement wants everyone to scavenge and reuse but has no curiosity in what a world like that would look like. It also has no curiosity as to why these systems exist in the first place and what possibly ways we could change them to greater enhance reusability. Maybe there are ways that the government or other entices could help redistribute food, maybe the reason we don't already give out food that "looks good enough to eat" is because certain regulations are in place to make sure you don't eat literal poison. They are stuck in this framework of individuals, it is the consumers vs anti-consumer and if you are an anti-consumer you can do just about anything in order to fight the good fight, like stealing, breaking public property, scaming people, living in abandoned buildings, etc. They literally say go with your gut in on what is right and wrong in the manifesto. again they heed no mind to whether or not these systems are in place for a reason, its just take what you can get mentality.
