Transcendentalism came about when settler came to a new world and god slowly became no longer the center of their lives. 
Transcendentalism starts with the unification of god and the world into one concept. God no longer is a person but the fabric of reality transformed from a dark mourner's cloth into a nice cozy blanket

Okay so I was right Transcendentalism is the belief that god cannot be comprehended by mortals and thus Transcends ours notion of person hood

However Transcendentalism goes beyond that sense the knowledge of god can't be know or understood by people the same way consciousness can't be known or understood then that means everyone has kind of their own unique god. We are all describing the same ineffable thing but this god is experienced by each individual uniquely which makes each god your own. "To each there own god" if you will

Neurodivergents is just a way of looking at the world that falls very far out of the norm. The only real difference between neurodivergent people and neurotypical people is that he way they react to stimuli diverges from the norm. This leads to sometimes genius and sometimes delusion just because they see things in a vastly different context. Neurodivergents is just type of diversity that can either help or hinder

Which is all well and good for him, but society is the tool by which we make everyone's lives better and so trying to turn into a subsitance culture is backwards to me personally

It is interesting to me how communes built themselves up and tour themselves apart by either by themselves or the outside world. It is nice to hear the the Ripley experiment wasn't a disaster but a nice getaway that ran into unfortunate finical troubles and then amicably disbanded. 

But I think there in lies the problem with communes is that the garden of eden is simple to delicate a construct to with stand the overwhelming might of the outside world, or the shifting changes in people. It might be a necessary thing that we live at arms distance from one another so that we can make difficult decision about how as a society we live. I don't think that the inhumane treatment of those less fortunate than us is necessary but for instance a judge and a jury need to not know the parties involved personally and in a social structure that is built on a tight knit community I am unsure if justice can be administered adequately as to not cause scsim
