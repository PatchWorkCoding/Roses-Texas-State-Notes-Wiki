So communes are developed in opposition to large, predefined, and inflexible modes of organization, instead they seek to find the best ways to serve one another in the larger communal sense. These however makes them resistant to collaboration with other communes and thus makes alliances between communes to form larger structures extraordinarily difficult, and at societal scales impossible

Communes that use spiritualism or religion as the glue that holds them together tend to be the most stable. This may be because religious or spiritual values are a code of ethics everyone can carry with them where as other communal conflict resolution structures happen to infrequently to handle the serious kinds of conflict that lead to communal breakdowns

To expand on the previous point I think religion and spirituality are just the easiest ways of giving people an idea of what inalienable rights they poses. Or more accurately what lines exist where and what freedoms they are entitled to. For example the average american person will fight tooth an nail no matter what side of the political isle your on for the right to continued social security because we all feel entitled to those protections. Religion is really good at telling you what god expects of you and what you can expect from god. There is a way to make this happen in a non-religious context see the social security example, but we haven't really looked into the tools necessary to make the happen

Communes maintain strict gender roles, I think this is a hold over from the modern society they left. If no one has a problem with gender roles or thinks to look outside of the gendered norm then will persist. norms are only overturned if there is a reason for it

Communes also don't really account for privacy which I think is a problem. sometimes we just want to be alone

Communes are also constantly hassled by authorities which puts outsized pressure on the communal relationships
