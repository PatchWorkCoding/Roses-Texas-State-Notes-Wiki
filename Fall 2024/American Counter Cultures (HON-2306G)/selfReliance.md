Knowledge is an act you do not something bestowed on you. If you want to learn or be smart you must speak your own thoughts and opinions and be ready to change your mind. Knowledge is something in your bones that you can explain effortlessly, like riding a bike

You gotta love the individualist! If I shit in my pants it is my choice alone to do so. Sure but I still gotta smell it. I am making the choice to actively make the world a worse place as it is my right.

Those who believe in doctrine wholely and truly are incapable of making spontaneous thought. Yes and No. I think he is correct in stating that most religious zealots are not allowed to entertain other ideas lest their minds be changed. He is advocating for people to think for themselves such that they may find a really truth or at least a better understanding of a real truth. But I think he comes up short again because one can come to a truth in their own right and recognize the need for community. Not believing doctrine and finding your own truth doesn't mean that you forgo community or that to dawn the outfit and to become similar to your peers is inherently bad or against this idea of "finding truth for yourself"

We are also afraid to break with habit. We are all beings of inertia held prisoner to the action of our past even though we do not need to do so. I agree mostly again Emerson is an individualist and so believes we have no duty to society at all, which I primarily disagree we do have duty to each other but it is a balancing act of conformity and freedom that we must maintain. I am all for maximizing positive freedom, but to maximize freedom in its whole also maximizes negative freedom.

This is the at least for me the pendulum of Emerson because on the one had we agree that everyone is equal and no greater or lesser than another. But out of this idea Emerson believes that not only do we have no duty or power over one another we should have no duty or power over one another. Where as I believe that while yes we inherently have no power over one another we still need to bestow power to people in order to get things done. American is built on the principle that if the people don't like whose in charge we can boot them out for someone else. So power is given but it is given voluntarily

Oh also we believe in a Truth at this point in history btw

We are slightly repeating ourselves now but what he is saying is that truth is not in the words we speak but in actions and experiences. You can not know god if you don't live in the world. You can not know a rose if all you do is read about it. Every rose their for is Truth because they all hold in them the experience of the rose

It feels paradoxical but I think it is true that we should on the one hand be expected to help our community "From each according to his ability, to each according to his need" while simultaneously people should not be used by others as crutches. We should all have the freedom to say "nope! I am done" and walk away

Theres the 1840s coming out of Emerson. Technology makes us weak! A point as old as time itself.

Technology doesn't make us weak it alters us forever, making us different and stronger

Pull yourself up by your boot straps fellas!
