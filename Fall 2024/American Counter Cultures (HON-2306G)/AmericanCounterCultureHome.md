# American Counter Cultures
you know the counter cultures! Hippies, Communists, and Union Worker. The political fringe of the popular culture.

The biggest question I want to see if I can answer is: was the counter culture killed by the digital age because popular culture was killed by the digital age? or does it live on in a form unrecognizable to its hippie past?
