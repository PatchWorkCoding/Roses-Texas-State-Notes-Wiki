It is interesting to see a real case of "people with the right intentions going to far" normally such cases are made by neo-liberals about leftist in an attempt to appear like they are aligned with our ideas while simultaneously trying to make effective implementation of those ideas impossible. "Oh we want to see justice for all, just not like this!"

ELF and ALf are natural causes I think of the political landscape. The earth is burning and the government doesn't listen. So people riot to make the government listen

Also these ideas of radical environmentalism seem counter-intuitive. We need to drastically reduce  the population so nature can flourish? is humanity not a part of nature, and more importantly aren't the objections to our treatment of nature is that we seek to pillage it for resources, destruction in kind doesn't seem like a great answer. An eye for an eye and all that
