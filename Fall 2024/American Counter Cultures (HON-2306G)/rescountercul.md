# It's time to resurrect the Counterculture Movement Notes:

I sometimes forget the MLK JR. is a preacher which means there are somewhat unremovable ties between the civil rights movement and religious belief which would be interesting to explore at a later date

So the counterculture was born using the vietnam war as a catalyst that forced those anti-war protesters to re-examine American culture and realize that the war is a symptom of a much larger "cultural problem" and the way they proposed to fix that was by "changing culture"

The trump catalyst did end up happening but only near the end of his presidency. Covid and the George Floyd Protests along with the internet were major radicalizing forces that got people to march on mass, same with the Genocide in Palestine, all of these caused and are causing great cultural waves but like all waves they fizzle out. Waves don't leave that much impact on culture anymore

If like part of the reason the counterculture failed is on this idea that "all you have to do to change the world is change your mind man!" because if you want to change society that are more efficient ways and also way more measurable ways 

I generally agree with the statement that liberation is the ability to do what you want whenever you want to do it. Or more accurately the freedom to purse happiness on your own time. If you want a system that makes that possible then I have a German philosopher you might love to read

Thats the hard part about our hippie for bears. They did succeed in changing conciousness at least a little bit. The voters the days are more progressive and many progressive policies are extraordinarily popular. The only problem is two fold. One the system is rigged in such a way that makes it extraordinarily difficult to make change happen, and two the death of utopian idealism leads to this less euphoric feeling of bring about social change. I don't vote for policy thinking that we are almost at the door of utopia. I vote so that I may be able to exist openly and freely tomorrow
