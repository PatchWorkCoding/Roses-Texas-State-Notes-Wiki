"And the other day I got mad at a Negro. He was so ashamed of being a Negro that he had stopped being human. When I reached out to him for a human response he just burrowed farther inside his brown skin and wouldn't come out." 

"She had made up her mind before not to go all the way with him, and now that she has, she no longer understands herself. Her selfimage is shaken. She says she did it because she loves him so much and still does."

"But did she ever try to tell them about it? And would they listen?"

Thats strong stuff. Its true and its strong the same way absinthe is. It feels weird hearing these prayers so stuck in the past that sometimes it is painful, Be so poignant in todays society.

And that is the answer you'll get from a lot of religions. They don't what to take action merely repent. Don't fix things but instead ask to be forgiven and try and move on with your life. Why address this issue when you can make yourself feel clean

That is a bit harsh, this whole text is prayer to god ot fix these problems and to try and bring peoples attentions to these problems, So they aren't doing nothing.

I just get mad when people feel sorry for themselves rather than try and do something about it
