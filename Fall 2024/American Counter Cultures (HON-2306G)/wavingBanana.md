Okay so the abstract of this article is basically the Freegans fixation on talking about how the eat out of the dumpster is ultimately detracting from their movement by putting off regular people

Freegans are an NSM (New social Movement) these movements are post industral, post modern, post a lot of things. This is where most of our social movements exist in 2024

NSM seek to politicize general fields of behavior in order to ask really radical questions. For instance the freegans have politicized the acts of acquiring consuming food in order to ask about thw ends of personal and social life

Model NSMs choose arenas for collective action that are ‘presumed safe’ from contention, subverting and re-appropriating popular symbols in ways that force people to take notice (Gamson, 1991). By targeting fields where ‘symbolic investments and pressure to conform are heaviest’ (Melucci, 1989: 12), collective actors create spaces in which they can assert an alternative identity. 

NSMs, some have argued, have abandoned the traditional leftist concern with redistribution in favor of a politics of recognition, which drastically alters their capacity to achieve long-term change

They are instead concerned with total disengagement rather than trying to change the system

Freegans are against engage with systems such as paying rent but ultimately have to engage with these systems on some level in order to live in the world.

I am also against engage with some of these system, however I do engage with them in order the change them and that sports fans is the pepsi difference

Freegans seem to have an intense focus on dumpster diving and food scavanging because it gets people to talk about them. I mean thats why we're here right? they scavenge as a form of political theatre these actions are undertaken partly in order to get people to think about what trash is, what it represents.

Freegans very carefully craft the experience of dive tours in order to better bring in outsiders who might be a little hesitant:
* They generally start with bakeries who throw out perfectly good food in relatively sanitary trashcans which makes it super easy to find food that isn't super off putting.
* They dive in wealthier neighborhoods I submit because they are generally cleaner
* They operate from 8pm - 10pm after most people get off work, but before the cops or sanitary works come out
* They also have a list of unwritten rules that everyone going on the tour must abide by

I would be interested to see if these practices really came about because they want to bring more people into the movement or if they just noticed that more people stick around when the engage in these practices and so are blindly running through carefully crafted routine. I guess it doesn't make a difference either way but it would be an interesting question

These trash tours consisting of upwards of twenty people are also great at drawing the attention of passers by who would otherwise not engage with the situation. This has the knock-on effect that it helps legitimize the Freegans mode of being.

The tours aren't only about instruction but also about showing people the value of the acts. Freegans will either show-off or hand out dumpster finds so that people have a more concrete idea of what the activity entails

It is commendable how much media presents the Freegans have and how they are able to control that presence so effectively. It makes you wonder why I have never heard of them, and why nobody joined they cause. Honestly it seems like they have the inverse problem as a lot of other political organizations. Where other organizations have easy on-boarding but no media-attention or poor representation, the freegans have all the media-attention in the world but it is impossible to get people into the lifestyle

In order to be mimetically viable in the media landscape you must be outrageous, but in order to be effective in bringing people into your cause you must be approachable. which is a hard circle to square

However I think the media landscape has changed in such a fundamental way that the content suggestion algorithm is more likely to drip feed political content until you radicalize vs back then when the thing that sold add space was outrageous reality tv shows that would hook the audience attention. Sex sold when you used to have to flip through television channels to find something good to watch, now the content is brought directly to you by a personally trained algorithm so the message has to be as widely appealing as possible. So there can't be any lampooning of other cultural ideas.
