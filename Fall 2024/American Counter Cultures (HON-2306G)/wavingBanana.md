Okay so the abstract of this article is basically the Freegans fixation on talking about how the eat out of the dumpster is ultimately detracting from their movement by putting off regular people

Freegans are an NSM (New social Movement) these movements are post industral, post modern, post a lot of things. This is where most of our social movements exist in 2024

NSM seek to politicize general fields of behavior in order to ask really radical questions. For instance the freegans have politicized the acts of acquiring consuming food in order to ask about thw ends of personal and social life

Model NSMs choose arenas for collective action that are ‘presumed safe’ from contention, subverting and re-appropriating popular symbols in ways that force people to take notice (Gamson, 1991). By targeting fields where ‘symbolic investments and pressure to conform are heaviest’ (Melucci, 1989: 12), collective actors create spaces in which they can assert an alternative identity. 

NSMs, some have argued, have abandoned the traditional leftist concern with redistribution in favor of a politics of recognition, which drastically alters their capacity to achieve long-term change
