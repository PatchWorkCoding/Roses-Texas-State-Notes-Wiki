# Welcome!
These are collection of notes from Rose Ott During her time at Texas State.

She desires to be unshackled from propretary software such as google docs and microsoft office, although she does expect to be forced to use those tools main times this semester. However she gets to dictate what she uses for her notes and as such has chosen the *.md* format. It is simple easy and can be hosted as a website with github. It also lets her express herself in ways that she finds exciting!
