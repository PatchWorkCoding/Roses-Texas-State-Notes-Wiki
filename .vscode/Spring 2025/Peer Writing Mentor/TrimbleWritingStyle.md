Like pretty much all proffessions writers have a "sense" a learned thought proccess that overtime becomes second nature to the point where you forget you are even doing it at all

On aspect of this writing sense that novices often haven't developed is the idea that your words are ultimately for someone else. You need to think of your reader and how they might interpret what you have put on the page. This lack of reader awareness leads ultimately to sloppy writing, formatting like footnotes, page numbers, and paragraph breaks are added only because they are expected of you by a teacher not because of what they convey

The author refers to this concept of writing with the reader in mind "unconscious writing"
