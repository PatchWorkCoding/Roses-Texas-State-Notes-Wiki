Why do we comment on students writing?

* On answer is for the same reasons that professional writers have perfessional editors. They need thoughtful comments that show were they went and were they went wrong as far as articulating their ideas as well as raise questions from a readers point of view
"We want to know if our writing has communicated our in-
tended meaning and, if not, what questions or discrepancies our reader sees
that we, as writers, are blind to."

* Another answer is we add comments because we want to our students to understand what a reader is going to ask of them. You add comments so they can get better at anticipating what questions will be asked and work them into the paper from the get-go. We want to train them to be a more effective self editor and a more effective editor in general.

* Comments motivate the student to revise in better ways. We want them to try new things in the next draft rather than polishing the current draft. Take a different argument or rearrange the whole paper. Then evaluate both and figure out which one you like more. Because without outside input students will revise in a very narrow way, believeing that they have effectively articualted the argument and now need to fix minor spelling mistakes and flow problems

Bad comments take a students attention a way from the best way to format the text and instead draw their attention to the purpose of the teachers comment. There is no analysis of the text and whether a comment is go or not, instead a student is trying to fit some arbitrary notion of "what does the teacher want me to write"

"Students make the changes the teacher wants rather than those that the student perceives are necessary, since the teachers' concerns imposed on the text create the reasons for the subsequent changes."

This wouldn't be so bad but teachers sometime give contradictory advise such as "expand this paragraph with more detail" and "this explaniation is to wordy". These contradiction will sometimes appear in the form of a general comment that tells to student to revise the whole paragraph while comments inside the paragraph direct the student to just reword a few sentences

"The interlinear comments and the marginal comments represent two separate tasks for this student; the interlinear comments encourage the student to see the text as a fixed piece, frozen in time, that just needs some editing. The marginal comments, however, suggest that the meaning of the text is not fixed, but rather that the student still needs to develop the meaning by doing some more research."

These comments also don't decern between what changes are more or less important. fixing a minor spelling mistake and reorganizing the whole paper are both given generally the same weight

"When the teacher appropriates the text for the student in this way, students are encouraged to see their writing as a series of parts-words, sentences, paragraphs-and not as a whole discourse."

This is one of the important notes to remember!! When presented with a paper you need to go beyond what is written there and look at over all structure. What is the paper trying to say and is it laid appropraitely for that? would it be better for the student to go back and rephrase sections differently

"The processes of revising, editing, and proofreading are collapsed and reduced to a single trivial activity, and the students' misunderstanding of the revision process as a rewording activity is reinforced by their teachers' comments."

I can feel Ms Andersons anger from here that I no longer remember the 7 steps to writing and revising she taught us back in middle school

Another problems with teacher comments is that they often aren't text specfic and could just as easily apply to any paper a student writes. Because they aren't text specific they can come off as vague only saying that a thing should be changed, not why it is wrong or how one might go about changing it

Basically teachers go into papers expecting to find errors that need to be corrected, so they find the easy spelling and grammar errors rather than the harder errors of sentence flow and paragraph rework that should happen sooner

Mainly all edits should be focused on bigger picture parts of the argument with concrete justification for why the critcism exists and preferably what can be done to fix it or at the very least a path forward

It is interesting that the
