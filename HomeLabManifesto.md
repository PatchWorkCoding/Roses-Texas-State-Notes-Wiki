# Welcome to the Home Lab:

## Introduction:
I want to break free of the industrial cloud! So much of my file data exists out there with no guarantee that it will be safe from being harvested by AI, or from the collapse of the platform. Right now I have maybe 24 GB in total of data just sitting out on the cloud that is costing me somewhere in the realm of $160 a year to hold out there. Now for the average person this is not only the cost of doing business, but easier and cheaper than the alternative of building their own self-hosted setup. However I think I could provide a great deal of service to my community by building infrastructure that can support well over what we can get from google drive for a fraction of the price. Moreover I think I can do a great deal of service to myself and my future job prospects by learning how computer networks operate, how servers interact with client, and how machines and web interfaces are designed to service those who use them. First and for most this project is for me. It is simply a Github, a NAS, and a portfolio website holder wrapped into one. But assuming I can get this to work it will hopefully be a community service to my friends who won't need to pay for excess storage space on the cloud, to my mother so she can host her website without Elementor, and a portable offline database that can exist independently of the larger outside ecosystem. 

## Project Scope
This project needs to fulfil the following requirements:
* Work as a personal git repository for me to hold my class notes and game projects
* Work as a google drive clone where I can store and share files with my friends 
* Work as a Web server to host a static portfolio site that allows companies to view my work
* Be portable enough that I can move it between my parents house and my apartment in San Marcos
* Be secure enough that I am not open to my files being stolen or my data being corrupted
* Be reliable enough that people aren't worried about long server outages
