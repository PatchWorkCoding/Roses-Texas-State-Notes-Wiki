# Chapter 5 Tension and Elastic Forces:


## Elastic Force
Force due to a spring rubber band bundige cord, etc. and other elastic materials

Written as `F(el)` it is a force with an S.I. Unit of `N`

### Equation
`F(el) = -k(Δd)`

`k` is the spring constant which is a scalar that is always positive and measure in `N/m` or newtons per meter

`Δd` is the displacement in meters from a defined equilibrium

you can forget about the signs for `Δd` and  the `-` in front of `k` because the orientation of the system supersedes it

There is a direct and linear relationship between the elastic force and the displacement. Move an object twice as the elastic pulls twice as much
