# Chapter 4: Forces

## Newtons Second Law (Law of Acceleration)

The acceleration of a system is
1. directly proportional to net forces on system
2. In the same direction as net force
3. Inversely proportional to the mass of the system 

### Equations

`a = ΣF/m` <- the acceleration of an object is equal to the sum of forces over mass

`ΣF` is the net force (sum of all forces in the system), its a vector measured in terms of Newtons `N`

`m` is the mass of the object which is always a positive number and measured in units of kilograms.

A more familiar way of seeing it is `F = ma`

The force of gravity is also called weight

`F = ma` doesn't give you velocity!!!

## Newtons 1st Law

An objects acceleration will remain zero until a force acts on it that makes it move. 

*Note: that doesn't mean the object doesn't move, constant velocity has zero acceleration.*

**Static Equilibrium:** an object with zero acceleration and zero net force that also has **Zero Velocity**

**Dynamic Equilibrium:** an object with zero acceleration and zero net forces that has **Non-Zero Velocity**

**Inertia** its the object resistance a change in its state of rest or state of motion and is proportional to mass

### Equations:
`Fa(Δv)` the force is directly promotional ot its change in velocity

## Force Checklist

* Gravity
* Normal
* Friction?
* Other contact Forces?

## Friction

There are two types of friction, static and kinetic.
Static friction is the friction force applied when the object is at rest and kinetic friction is the friction force applied when the object is moving

Friction force is relational to the normal force.

`Fr = μk(Fn)`

## Inertial and Non-Inertial Frames

**Inertial Frames** Object is moving with a constant velocity

An frame that is giving at a constant relative velocity to another inertial frame is itself and inertial frame

**Non inertial Frames** Object moving with a non-zero acceleration
