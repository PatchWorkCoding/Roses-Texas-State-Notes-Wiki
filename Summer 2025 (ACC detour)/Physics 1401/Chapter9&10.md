# Torque and Rotational Motions

## General equations

### identities  
**Angular Displacement:** `Δθ = θf - θi` where `Δθ` is measured in rads

**Angular Velocity:** `ωavg = Δθ/Δt` where `ωavg` is measured in rads/s

**angular velocity:** `αavg = Δω/Δt` where `αavg` is measured in rads/s^2

### Kinematic equations:

1. `ωf = ωi + α(Δt)`
2. `ωf^2 = ωi^2 + 2α(Δθ)`
3. `θf = θi + ωi(Δt) + (1/2)α(Δt^2)`
4. `ωavg = Δθ/Δt = (ω1 + ω2) / 2`

### Work Equations

`K.E.rot = 1/2(I)(ω^2)`

`ΔK.E - 1/2(I)(ωf^2) - 1/2(I)(ωi^2)`

### Angular Momentum
`L = Iω` where `I` is measured as `kg * m^2` and `L` is measured in `(kg *  m^2) / s`

you can convert from angular and linear momentum with the equation `L = ||R||(||P||)(sin(θ[R,P]))`

`L` is constant, if `I` increases `ω` must decrease assuming no outside forces acts on the system 

### Arc Length + Linear Conversion
Arc Length `S = Rθ` where `R` is the radius and `θ` is an angle measured in rads

To convert take the angular equivalent of the linear and multiple by the radius

### Work around an angle:

`K.E.trans = (1/2)(m1(R1^2) + m2(R2^2) + m3(R3^2)...mn(Rn^2))(ω^2)`
