# Chapter 13: FLuid and Density

## Density 
`ρ = m/V` density equals mass `m` divided by volume `V` 

Density is a positive scalar with S.I. units of kg/m^3

## Pressure
The force per unit area

Equation of pressure is: `P = F / A`

Its a scalar that can be negative and is measured in SI units of N/m^2 

another S.I. Unit for pressure is Pascals `Pa`

Another equation `P = ρ * Δh * ag` <- pressure at some depth

the pressure `P` equals the density `ρ` multiplied by the change in height `Δh` multiplied by the gravitational constant `ag`

`Total pressure = Atmospheric Pressure + Fluid Pressure`

`Total pressure = Patm + ρ * Δh * ag`

`Total Pressure - Atmospheric Pressure` is called the *Gauge Pressure*

`ρ * Δh * ag` also referred to as the *Gauge Pressure*

`Volume of Displaced Fluid = % Volume of the object`

`` 

1 atm = 101325 Pa

### Youngs modulus
`Y = stress/strain = Preasure/ (Δd / d)`
