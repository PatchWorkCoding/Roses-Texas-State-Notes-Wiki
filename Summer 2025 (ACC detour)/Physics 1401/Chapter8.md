# Chapter 8 Momentum & Impulse

## Elastic and Inelastic Collisions:

### Elastic:
These are "hit and bounce" collisions where the objects collide and repel each other

Momentum is conserved and Kinetic Energy is conserved

### Inelastic
These are "hit and stick" collisions

Momentum is conserved but Kinetic energy is not conserved
