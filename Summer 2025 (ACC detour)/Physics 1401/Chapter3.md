# Chapter 3

## Simple Projectile Motion

**Definition:** an object in simple projectile motion is in *free fall* along the *vertical direction* and experience *constant velocity* along the *horizontal direction*

In the X-axis velocity is constant and so has a **Zero** acceleration


## Centripetal Acceleration

**Definition** when an object experiences only a centripetal acceleration, the object is in *Uniforms Circular Motion* (U.C.M)

* U.C.M means the object is moving at a constant speed with usually constant acceleration

* Period means the time it takes to complete one cycle

### Equations

`aR = aC = (vTangential^2) / R`

`aR` is the radial acceleration, `aC` centripetal acceleration. both are vectors that points towards center of the circular path and are measured in m/s^2

`R` is the radius of the circular path, its a vector that points away from the center of the circular path and is measured in meters

`vTangential` is linear velocity that is tangent to the circular path and is a vector measured in m/s

`speed = circumference/period = 2πr/T`

`T` is the period in seconds

`aR = aC = 4π^2R/T^2`

`angular velocity = ω = Δθ/Δt`

`linear speed = ωR`

`linear speed = 2πr* revs/s`
