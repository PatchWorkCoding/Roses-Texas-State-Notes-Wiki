# General Physics 1

First day and your girl is already late :p

## Significant figures:
Its important or some shit

## Vectors vs Scalars:
#### Vectors: 
a number with a direction. it can be an angle, an ordered pair, a compass direction

#### Scalars:
Just a number 


## Acceleration, Velocity, Displacement:
### Displacement: Change in Position measured in meters
* `Δd = d2 - d1`
* `Δd = df - di`
* `Δd = d - d0`
* `Δd = d1 + d2 + d3 + ...`
* `Δr = r - r0`

*Standard rule of thumb for vector direction `direction = where you are going to - where you are coming from*

It would be at the end of some time interval so for example if I move 70m to the right and 40m to the left my displacement would be 30m (or -30m depending on the direction scheme)

### Distance: The Length as measured along a path
Its also the scalar form of Displacement written in meters

#### Equations:
`distance = ||Δd1|| + ||Δd2||| + ||Δd3|| ...`

### Velocity: A change in position throughout some time
A vector measured in m/s

#### Equations:
* `Average Velocity = Δd/Δt`
* `Instantaneous Velocity = lim(Δt -> 0s) V(avg) = Δd/Δt`

### Speed: The distance throughout some time
the scalar version of velocity  measured in m/s

#### Equations:
* `Speed Average = S(avg) = distance/Δt` 
* `instantaneous speed = ||Instant Velocity||`

*Note that average speed != ||V(avg)||*


### Acceleration: The Change in velocity throughout some time
A vector measured in m/s^2

*Note: there is no scalar version of acceleration. At least not one with a name that we care about in this class*

#### Equations:
* `Acceleration Average = A(avg) = Δv/Δt = (v2 - v1) / (t2 - t1)`
* `instentaneous Acceleration = lim(Δt -> 0s) A(avg) = Δv/Δt`

## Kinematic Equations
1. `v2 = v1 + a(Δt)`
2. `(v2)^2 = (v1)^2 + 2a(Δd)`
3. `Δd = v1(Δt) + 1/2a(Δt^2)`
4. `Vavg = Δd/Δt = (v1 + v2)/2`

Note: these equations are only valid in the case of constant acceleration

## Free Fall:

Objects in free fall are ones where gravity is the only force acting on it. It can have an initial velocity that gravity is acting against but there can't be forces added to it

Gravitational constant: `g = -9.81m/s`

## Position/Velocity/Acceleration vs time graphs (Derivatives)

#### Slopes
The slope of the **position vs time** graph gives us the **Average Velocity**

The slope of the **Velocity vs time** graph give us the **Average acceleration**

#### The area under the curve
the area under the curve of a **Velocity vs Time** graph gives us the **displacement**

the area under the curve of an **Acceleration vs Time** graph gives us the **Average change in velocity**
