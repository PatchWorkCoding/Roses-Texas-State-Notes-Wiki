# Physics 1
## Table of contents

* [Chapter 2](Chapter2.md)
* [Chapter 3](Chapter3.md)
* [Chapter 4](Chapter4.md)

## Exam 1
Topics Covered
1. one dimensional motion (horizontal)
    * Most likely two objects.
2. One dimensional motion (vertical)
    * with free fall
3. Motion diagrams
    * Position vs time
        * slope = Vavg
    * Velocity vs time
        * slope = Aavg
        * area under curve = change in position
    * Accel vs time
        * area under curve = change in velocity

**Velocity defines direction of motion**

4. Projectile Motion
    * most likely initial velocity will be unknown
5. Newton's Laws of Motion 
    * most likely at an angle

**Friction is always opposite the direction of motion**

**The Normal is always perpendicular the to the direction of motion.**

**Set up time intervals**


## Exam 2:
Topics Covered:
1. Hooke's Law (Elastic Forces)
2. Archimedes' principle (Buoyancy Forces)
3. Uniform Circular Motion
4. Newtons Universal Law of Gravity
5. Work & Energy Problems

## Exam Final:
*Notes*:
* use energy when **only** instructed
* Convert Revs to Rads

Topics Covered:
1. Projectile Motion
    * solve through kinematics
    * solve through energy (velocity at max height in energy problems is `v(cos(Î¸))`)
2. N2L 
    * through N2L
    * through energy
3. Bouncy
    * Through N2L
4. Centripetal force Problem (Uniform Circular Motion)
5. Torque and Other rotational properties
6. Also Torque (Straight Up Torque)
7. Conservation of MEchanical Energy with Rotational K.E.
8. Conservator of Linear Momentum
9. Simple Harmonic Motion
