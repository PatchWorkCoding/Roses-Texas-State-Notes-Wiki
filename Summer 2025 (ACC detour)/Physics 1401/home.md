## Exam 1
Topics Covered
1. one dimensional motion (horizontal)
    * Most likely two objects.
2. One dimensional motion (vertical)
    * with free fall
3. Motion diagrams
    * Position vs time
        * slope = Vavg
    * Velocity vs time
        * slope = Aavg
        * area under curve = change in position
    * Accel vs time
        * area under curve = change in velocity

**Velocity defines direction of motion**

4. Projectile Motion
    * most likely initial velocity will be unknown
5. Newton's Laws of Motion 
    * most likely at an angle

**Friction is always opposite the direction of motion**

**The Normal is always perpendicular the to the direction of motion.**

**Set up time intervals**
