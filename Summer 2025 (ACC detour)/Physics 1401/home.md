# General Physics 1

First day and your girl is already late :p

## Vectors vs Scalars:
#### Vectors: 
a number with a direction. it can be an angle, an ordered pair, a compass direction

#### Scalars:
Just a number 


## Acceleration, Velocity, Displacement:
### Displacement: Change in Position measured in meters
* `Δd = d2 - d1`
* `Δd = df - di`
* `Δd = d - d0`
* `Δd = d1 + d2 + d3 + ...`
* `Δr = r - r0`

*Standard rule of thumb for vector direction `direction = where you are going to - where you are coming from*

It would be at the end of some time interval so for example if I move 70m to the right and 40m to the left my displacement would be 30m (or -30m depending on the direction scheme)

### Distance: The Length as measured along a path
Its also the scalar form of Displacement written in meters

#### Equations:
`distance = ||Δd1|| + ||Δd2||| + ||Δd3|| ...`

### Velocity: A change in position throughout some time
A vector measured in m/s

#### Equations:
* `Average Velocity = Δd/Δt`
* `Instantaneous Velocity = lim(Δt -> 0s) V(avg) = Δd/Δt`

### Speed: The distance throughout some time
the scalar version of velocity  measured in m/s

#### Equations:
* `Speed Average = S(avg) = distance/Δt` 
* `instantaneous speed = ||Instant Velocity||`

*Note that average speed != ||V(avg)||*


### Acceleration: The Change in velocity throughout some time
A vector measured in m/s^2

*Note: there is no scalar version of acceleration. At least not one with a name that we care about in this class*

#### Equations:
* `Acceleration Average = A(avg) = Δv/Δt = (v2 - v1) / (t2 - t1)`
* `instentaneous Acceleration = lim(Δt -> 0s) A(avg) = Δv/Δt`
