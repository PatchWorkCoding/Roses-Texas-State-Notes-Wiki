# Chapter 11:  Elastic and Periodic Motion

Periodic motion is governed by a few thing:

**Equilibrium** The "zero position" of a spring.

**Amplitude** the maximum displacement from equilibrium.

**Period** the time it takes a system to complete 1 cycle.

Period is independent of amplitude but dependant on mass

## Equations for Spring Harmonics:

angular frequency for 
* simple harmonic motion `ω = sqrt(k/m)`
* simple pendulum `ω = sqrt(ag / L)` where L is the length of the pendulum

position
`x = A`

velocity `Vmax = ωA`

acceleration `a = (ω^2)A`

`V = Vmax(sqrt(1-(x/A)^2))`

`-(ω^2)(Δx) = ax`

*Note that `A` denotes amplitude and `ω` denotes angular frequencies.*

Period (*Denoted as `T`*) is the time to complete 1 cycle and can be expressed as:
* `T = 1 / f`
* `T = time/cycles`

Frequency (*denoted as `f`*) is the number of cycles completed in a unit of time and can be expressed as
* `f = 1 / T`
* `f = cycles / time`

Angular Frequency (*denoted as `ω`*) is the number of revolutions completed in a unit of time and can be expressed as
* `ω = 2pi(f)`


## Equations for moving around a circle

**For the Y Direction**

Displacement `y = Rsin(Δθ)` or `y  = A(sin(ω*Δt))`

Velocity `vy = ω * A(cos(ω*Δt))`

Acceleration `ay = -ω^2 * A(sin(ω*Δt))`

*Note: just invert sin and cos for the X components*

**For the Y Direction**

Displacement `x  = A(cos(ω*Δt))`

Velocity `vx = -ω * A(sin(ω*Δt))`

Acceleration `ax = -ω^2 * A(cos(ω*Δt))`
