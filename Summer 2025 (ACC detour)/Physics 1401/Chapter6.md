# Chapter 6 Circular Motion


## Uniform Circular Motion
- Speed is constant, but direction of motion changes
- As something moves about a curved path, a centripetal acceleration is experienced by the object
    - according to newtons second law, an acceleration on a system means the system experiences a non-zero net external force 

This Force experienced by the system is referred to as *Centripetal Force* 

### Equations
`ac = ∑F/m`

centripetal acceleration `ac` is a vector measured in m/s^2 that always points toward the center of the circle

centripetal forces `∑F` is a sum which creates a center pointing vector measured in N


## Newton's (mostly) Universal Law of Gravity

Every object with a mass exerts an attractive force on another mass that
1. Directly proportional to the masses of both objects
2. Inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance between the center of mass of each object

### Equation for  N.U.L.G.
`Fg(a,b) = G ((mA * MB) / ((Ra,b)^2))`

`Fg(a,b)` Gravitational force of attraction between two masses which is a vector measured in Newtons

`G` the gradational constant scalar which is always positive and is measured in (N * Meters^2) / kg^2 

`mA, mB` the masses of A and B measured in kg

`R(a,b)^2` The separation distance between the center of each mass of each object, which is an always positive scalar measured in meters

`G = 6.67 * 10^-11` (N * Meters^2 / kg^2)
