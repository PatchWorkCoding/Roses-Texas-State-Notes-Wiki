# IP (Intellectual property):
Definition: IP refers to creations of the mind
* inventions
* literary and artistic works
* Symbols, names, images used in commerce


## Locke: The second treatise of Government
People have a right to

Limits to intellectual property protection
* Giving creators rights to their inventions stimulates creativity
* Society benefits most when inventions are placed in the public domain
* US congress has struck compromise by giving authors and inventors rights for a limited time

## Trade Secrets:
* A form confidential of intellectual property rights that don’t expire
* Secrecy of the intellectual property must be kept and maintained by the company.
* A famous example of a trade secret is the formula for coca-cola’s special syrup
* Could be compromised if an employee leaves the firm

## Trade Marks:
* Identifies a good
* Identifies a service
* They are used to establish company "brand name"
* if a brand name becomes a noun, trademark may be lost (i.e. band-aid)
* Companies need to keep up protection on their trade mark or else they will loose it

## Copyright
Gives owner original work five rights 
* Reproduction 
* Distribution 
* Public display 
* Public performance 
* Production of derivative works 
Copyright doesn't expire until 70 years past the death of the original creator

Copyright is automatically given once you create a work

Certain restrictions exist on copyright called "fair use"

Copyright is anything that can be shown or distributed 

## Patent
* Public document that provides detailed description of an invention or a thing that is going to be created
* provides exclusive rights to an invention or an idea
* Last only 20 years

The different types of patents:
* **Utility Patents** - for inventing a new or improved and useful process, machine, article of manufacture, or composition of matter.
* **Design Patents** - for inventing a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture.
* **Plant Patents** - for inventing or discovering and asexually reproducing any distinct and new variety of plant.


In order to patent something 4 things must exist:
* Able to be used (the invention must work and cannot just be a theory)
* A clear description of how to make and use the invention
* New, or “novel” (something not done before)
* “Not obvious,” as related to a change to something already invented

## Fair Use
The conditional reproduction of a copyrighted works without permission

To judge fair use, courts consider four factors:
* purpose of character of use
* Nature of work
* Amount of work being copied
* Affect on market for work

### Time shifting
Recording the data in order hold it and use it at a later date

Example: it is fair use to record a video tape to watch later but not to record a video to re

### Space shifting
Making copies to use in multiple devices, or backing up data 

Example: it is fair use to record a cd onto a cassette to play later, it is not legal to record a cd onto a cassette and give it to a friend

## Digital Rights management (DRM)
The set of policies and protocols for how to create, store, distribute, and delete

DRM undermines Fair use

DRM is not a permanent fix and can always be

DRM could reduce competition by not allowing people to remix IP

Some schemes make anonymous access impossible

## Peer to Peer Networks
Its an Ad-hoc network made up of computers that communicate together without any mediating centralized server.

Connected computer running the same networking program

Computers can access files stored on each other's hard drives

* Gives each user access to data stored in many other computers
* Support simultaneous file transfers among arbitrary pairs of computers
* allow users to identify systems with faster file exchange speeds

## Cyberlockers (Cloud Storage)
Basically a secure storage place somewhere on the open internet that you can allow others users to access

Think github or google drive

## Examples of Peer to Peer and cyberlockers
### Napster
Was a peer to peer music exchange network that got sued by the RIAA and forced to go off line in July 2001

### Bit Torrent
Downloads a lot faster than other systems because multiple server give you the parts of the material all at once rather than just strictly from a server

## Protections for Software
Copyright for software begins in 1964
What gets copyrighted?
* expression of an idea, not the idea itself
* object program, not the source program
    * The .exe can be copyrighted but the source program can not be

Source code is a companies trade secret

Reverse engineering does not break copyright

Unconscious copying is a violation of copyright

Microsoft files ~3,000 patents exist annually

Patent trolls are people who sit on patents not making anything but instead stop people from making anything unless they pay them for access to the patent

you are not allowed to reverse engineer a patent

**Unconscious copying** is when someone can prove you saw copyrighted material and you copied it either knowingly or unknowingly 

Software can be patented and it has been allowed since 1981, and since then court rulings have allowed wider ranges of patents on software
