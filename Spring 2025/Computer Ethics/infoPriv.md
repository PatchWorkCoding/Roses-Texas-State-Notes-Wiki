# Info Privacy

## Information Technology Erodes Privacy
Scott McNealy: "You have zero privacy anyway. Get Over it"

Deduction goes from the general to the specific

Inference goes from the specific to the general

## Privacy

Privacy is the ability to control the access to information.

### Harms of Privacy
* can be used to cover up illegal or immoral activities
* Can be a burden on the nuclear family (?)
* Can hide dysfunctional families (?)
    * I understand what they are saying but all of this kinda falls under "immoral activities" the focus on the family unit specifically is a lil weird 
* People on society's fringes can be ignored 
    * this implies to me to talk about queer people but 

### Benefits
* Necessary for each individuals growth as a unique person
* signals that individuals are responsible for themselves
* recognizes everyone's true freedom
* Lets people be themselves

Basically the argument is that Privacy is a balancing act, if people have to much privacy then we can't know if they are committing immoral acts. But if we take away people privacy we don't let them develop in an environment where they don't get judged

The ability to hide information is a way to garner power, the question about privacy is truly a one centered around who has power

## Privacy as a Natural Right

### A Natural Right
Are you 

### Not a Natural Right
Judith Jarvis Thomson argument is that the natural right argument "the right to be let alone" is both simultaneously to broad and to narrow
* It is to narrow because it doesn't cover concepts like spying where you aren't directly bothering anyone but still violating their privacy
* It is to broad because it does include things that are already illegal like assault


## Privacy and Trust

There is an argument that we are more private than we have ever been. We tend to live alone or in groups of maybe 2 ~ 5 in houses we never leave. We don't know who our neighbors are, we travel in cars so we don't talk with people on the bus. We have phones that deliver personalized and private entrainment that we watch alone, and is personally chattered to us.

**The Challenge**: We live in a world of strangers. Surrounded by people but are ultimately alone. So the question become how do we trust anyone?

**Remedy**: We now trust people based on reputations that are developed either through 
* Ordeals such as lie detectors, standardized tests, or drug screening
* Credentials ID's, Degrees, Social Cred

In order to establish a reputation you must necessarily give up your privacy, and sell parts of your self away. Which is not always a bad thing

## Public Records:

Information about an incident or an action that is reported to a government agency for the purpose of informing the public, i.e. Police reports, Births, marriages, licenses and registrations, criminal records, deeds to a property

We are concerned about it in this class because the internet now holds all those private records

### Information Held by Private Organizations:
this is information allowed to held by a private organizations through the use of their services, everything from the way google tracks your data, to how banks track your purchase history

Data gatherings is an important questions because everyone is gathering your data and it isn't always bad

## Ownership of Transaction Information
Who controls transaction infromation?
* The Buyer?
* The Seller?
* Both?

# Government side of Info Privacy

## Solove’s Taxonomy of Privacy
This is a framework that categorizes the harms that arise from privacy infringement
* Information Collection: Activities that Gathers personal information. such as survalience
* Information processing: Activities that store, manipulate, and use personal information that has been collected
* Information dissemination: Activities that spread personal information
* Invasion: Activities that intrude upon a person’s daily life, interrupt someone’s solitude, or interfere with decision making

## Employee Polygraph Protection Act

A law passed in 1988 that prohibits employers from using lie detector tests under most condition, and they cannot require test for employment

Exceptions
* Pharmaceutical companies and security firms may give test to certain classes of employees
* employers who have suffered a theft may administer test to a reasonable suspects
* Federal, state, and local government are exempt

## Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
reduces amount of public information gathered from children by requiring that online services must gain parental consent before collection information from children 12 and under

## Genetic Information Nondscrimination Act

Health Insurance Companies

Employers

## Information Collection by the Government

### Census Records

Allows the state to (in theory) create a representative government with many

### IRS Records
The 16th Amendment to the US constitution gives the federal government the power to collect an income tax, which necessitates the collection of a tremendous amount of personal information

### FBI Nation crime information centers 2000 (NCIC)
A collection data base of almost 39 million different crimes

We need to know examples of legislation that deals with the four sections of Solovo's Taxonomy. Exact Details are less important


## Code of Fair Information Practices
1. No secret databases
2. People should have access to their personal information in the database
3. Organization cannot change how they use your information with out your permission
4. People should be able to correct and amend their records
5. Database owners, users responsible for reliability of data and preventing misuse

## Fair Credit Reporting


## Data Mining
look through large sources of data for patterns

Government Agencies like the IRS use data mining to look for fraud or errors

## Syndromic Surveillance Systems
Syndromic surveillance systems is a form of data mining used to find patterns relating to epidemics or bioterrorism
