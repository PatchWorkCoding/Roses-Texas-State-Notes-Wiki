# Paper 2 Reading

## General Arguments:
If a task is automated is deemed no longer worthy of knowing or caring about, Is this true of the output of AI? is the code it spits out good enough to trust your life to?

AI interrupts flow state


## Using GitHub Copilot to Solve Simple Programming ProblemsUsing GitHub Copilot to Solve Simple Programming Problems:

The Facts and figures could be used to show how bad AI is right now at writing code

Programming Patterns

On the other hand, it fails to solve half of these simple problems.
While Copilot can be instructed to incrementally fix or improve a
program, the user must know exactly what they want and find the
right words to communicate their intentions. It’s easier and quicker
to edit the code directly.
Copilot sometimes uses constructs novice programmers might
not know about, like list comprehensions. How students will react
to such suggestions remains to be seen.

## Randomly Cut Elements
Many people have a vested interest in making AI assisted programming a reality. From the companies that produce these tools, to the bosses and middle managers who seek to make their work spaces more efficient, to some solo devs who see it  as a way to increase their productivity 10 fold. However in this rush to revolutionize the profession of programming with AI there has been only marginal consideration for how this technology will impact students currently studying the field of computer science, and how their relationship to the profession will change when they graduate.
As a computer science student I exist in uncertain times. On the one hand the university is telling me I need to learn the fundamentals of  data structures and algorithms, and how to code. But on the other hand I am hearing large tech company CEOs say that coding will be a thing of the past, and that in 10 years time we won’t even have junior developers anymore. Some AI services, most notably Devin, are currently being sold as an AI you can hire in order to replace junior level programmers.
Ever since Bill Gates dropped out of college in order to start Microsoft, computer scientists from around the world have asked themselves “am I wasting my time here?”. With the advent of AI programming assistants this question has only grown larger in complexity and 

In this paper I will discuss how new AI tools that are designed to increase productivity by “eliminating grunt work” tend to eliminate the jobs required for graduates who are just starting a career to gain the necessary skills and footing to be able to excel in the job market. I will be discussing this issue through the lens of productivity in the computer science field by looking at 5 different contemporary AI tools that all have applications in programming: ChaptGPT, Github Copilot, Devin AI, Windsurf, and Cursor.
