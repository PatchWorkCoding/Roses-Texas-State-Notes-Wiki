# Ethics In Emerging IT notes:

## Introduction and Abstract
Paper Terms: 
* ATE - (anticipatory technology ethics)

The authors central argument in this paper is that in our modern age the study of ethics needs to concern itself not only with current technologies but future technologies and what ramifications those could have. 

The Author proposes a new framework (ATE) that is broken down into 3 steps each one concerned around different ethical questions and concerns.

## Ethics and Stages of technological emergence

### Moor's 3 stages of Technological Emergence

#### The Introduction Stage:
This when the technology is first emerging it exists only as prototypes or on chalk boards and is only used by a small few user

#### The Permeation Stage:
This is the stage when the product goes public and more and more people are picking it up and using it, the user base is growing and the price is dropping

#### The Power Stage:
This is the final stage of mass adoption when almost everyone has the technology and it is very easy to acquire.

*The article characterizes these stages as primarily associated with how big the user base is and how easy the technology is to acquire for the general user. A note should be made here that some technology doesn't need to be owned by the vast majority of the public in order to still have a great impact. For example medical technology like X-Rays and MRIs, industrial grade servers, and high powered restaurant dishwashers all have profound impacts on our lives but are not owned by the majority of people.*

As we move through these stages the amount, variety and impact of these stages grows exponentially. The more people use the devices the more uses for the device will be found, and thus the ethical questions around those uses will be profound as well.

The author Argues here that Moor missed a stage that is critical for ATE which is the R&D stage.

#### R&D Stage:
The R&D stage comes before the introduction stage when a devices is still theoretical and is actively being developed. Ethical questions in this stage are largely theoretical and generalized, focusing on the "what would happen if" rather than the "what is happening" because the device actively doesn't exist, uses case fore the device don't exist, and importantly there are valid questions around whether or not the device can ever exist.

Even if the ethical questions surrounding a given device may or may not be fruitful considering the device has a potential for not existing. There still needs to be an Ethic concerned with how we develop this technology. For example if development has a potential cause harmful byproducts then research should steer clear of those methods and instead try to find alternatives and workarounds.

### Questions Answered in the section
* What are the characteristics of an emerging technology and
how is it different from a technology that is fully realized
and established in society? 
* How would an ethics of emerging technology be different from an ethics of established technology?

## Ethical Approaches to Emerging Technologies:

In order to get around the problem of Ethical uncertainty when analyzing emerging technologies the author proposes two different approaches

#### Generic Approach:
The generic approach is one more grounded in reality concerning itself with the mostly known ramifications of creating a given technology. For example when creating nuclear power all evidence at the time pointed to the inescapable production of nuclear waste and so ethical questions had to asked about what to do with that waste.

#### Forecasting Approach:
The forecasting approach is more speculative in nature concerning itself with the what if aspects of creating the given technology. For example if we were able to create thinking robots what kinds of rights would they be owed and would the be considered human or not? 

*These questions I would argue are less helpful then the Generic approach because they are often very real possibilities that a given technology won't pan out or that the predictions are flat out wrong. This approach has all of the same problems as normal speculation*

That being said there are tools and methodologies that experts in a given field use to make ethical predication all the time.

*This is part of the intended way technology is meant to advance. Like scientific innovations a given technology should have to justify itself to a user base that is taking into account the ethical ramifications of using those devices. In order for the ethical adoption of technology I would argue that there needs to be a democratic adoption of that technology that we don't have in our current society.*

One forecasting approach that exists out there is ethical technology assessment (eTA) a branch of technology assessment that focusing around ethical issues. It is a workable theory however the author points out that it is to vague and limiting in its methodology

## Anticipatory Technology Ethics (ATE):
From the book "What we have seen in the previous section is that an ethical approach to emerging technologies has to overcome various obstacles: it has to engage in forecasting without becoming too speculative, it has to integrate forecasting analyses with ethical analysis in which a normative stance is maintained, and it has to attain a certain breadth in doing so."

One of the major characteristics of ATE is that it contains three different levels of ethical analysis:

#### Technology Level
This is the level where the whole field of study also referred to in this case a "technology" is analyzed ethically. To quote the book "A technology is a collection of techniques that are related to each other because of a common purpose, domain, or formal or functional features." The Article use "nuclear technology" as an example of technology and how an analysis of it at this layer asks questions like "is nuclear technology a net benefit for humanity if it can be used to build a bomb" 

#### Artifact Level
An artifact is anything that is created as a result of a technology. To continue with the nuclear technology example artifacts from that technology would be: Nuclear Bombs, Nuclear power plants, smoke detectors, and x-ray imagining. Another product of a technology is a *procure* which is a sequences of action which under specified circumstances produces a desired result. Artifacts are similar defined to procedures but an artifact is something physical where as a procedure is something conceptual. A sword is an artifact, how one goes about making that sword is a procedure.

*This distinction is interesting because it puts ethical weight on the existence of a device. This feels backwards to me because surely the thing that makes a devices ethically good or bad is in what it allows you to do.*

#### Application Level
This level is concerned with the actual ways a procedure or an artifact can be used both intentionally and unintentionally. Applications also encompass a devices could be modified to enable other actions.
