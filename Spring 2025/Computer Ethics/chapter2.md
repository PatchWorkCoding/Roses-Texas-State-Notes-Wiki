## What is ethics

**Ethics**: The philosophical study of morality, a **rational** examination into people’s moral beliefs and behavior. 

**Society**: an association of people organized under a system of **rules** designed to advance the good of its members over time. 

**Morality**: A Society's rules of conduct describing what people ought and ought not to do in various situations.

The study of Ethics doesn't really exist without a society since their are no moral actors for you to do good or bad things to. *This of course assumes that Animals or the earth are not moral actors and that you can't do good or bad things to yourself*

The study of Ethics only applies to actions we have control over that directly relate to morals. For example pulling the leveler to choose which track trolley goes down is an ethical questions, but choosing what color that trolley is, or walking up to the podium,tripping, and accidentally pulling the lever aren't.

## Unworkable Theories

**Ethical Relativism**: There are no universal moral norms of right and wrong. This Theory is often divided into to different groups, *Subjective Relativism* and *Cultural relativism*

**Subjective Relativism**: There does not exist a thing called "morality" that one can measure like gravity. Instead morality is something that is created by the individual and there is no objective metric to differentiate between individual moral stances

Peoples biggest problem with subjective relativism is that it is often used as a way to shut down ethical arguments by saying "no one really knows the answer so why even argue about it." The lack of an objective metric leads to the conclusion that subjective relativism is stating that all view points are equally valid.

**Cultural Relativism**: The ethical theory that the meaning of “right” and “wrong” rests with a society’s actual moral guidelines. These guidelines vary from place to place and from time to time.

**Divine Command Theory**: Good actions are those aligned with the will of God and bad actions are those contrary to the will of God.

**Ethical Egoism**: The morally right action for a person to take in a particular situation is the action that will provide that person with the maximum long-term benefit.

## Workable Theories

**Kantianism**: An ethical theory derived from a specific way of reasoning developed by Kant. Central to its belief system is that there exist objective rules of morality that can be found and understood through this reasoning. To act Ethically you must abide according to the rules derived from the reasoning personal feelings be damned!

**Imperatives**: The way reasoning commands the will. It is the force that makes us do an action outside our baseline desires. It is the force that makes you clean your house for company even though you would much rather doing anything else. 
* **Hypothetical Imperatives**: This is a contextual and concrete kind of Imperative. "If you want X do Y". "If you want to lose weight, eat less"
* **Categorical Imperatives**: Always applies unconditionally no matter context or circumstance. An example could be "It is taking the life of an innocent person."

*Only Categorical Imperatives can be moral imperatives because morals are universal according to Kant*

Kant derives these Categorical Imperatives through a series of rules or as he calls them *Formulations*.

The first and most interesting is: "Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws." Or in other words if everyone acted the way you are acting would this lead to a logical contradiction

The example the book gives is about making a promise you wish to break later. In order for you to make that promise you need to have the person believe you. In order for the person to believe you then they must assume promise are always kept. If you don't keep your promises then promises aren't always kept, which means this person won't believe you. Its a contradiction. In other words if the action you commit necessitate no-universality than it is an immoral action.

*Lying is immoral because it requires everyone except you not be able to lie. In this framing Kant's inflexibility is kind of seen as making an Ethical code of conduct based on fairness which I think is really interesting*

The second Formulation of the Categorical Imperatives is: "Act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end." Basically don't use people to get what you want, or in other words "treat people the way you want to be treated."

**In summary the two main imperatives are:** 
* Can the law apply to everyone without contradiction? - "Act only from moral rules that you can at the same time will to be universal moral laws."
* Does this action treat someone as an ends and not an person? - "Act so that you always treat both yourself and other people as ends in themselves, and never only as a means to an end."

*The main problem I have with Kant's Philosophy is that is focused on "why" some one did somethings and not "what" they did. Take lying for example there are scenarios where it can be moral justified because it produce a better outcome for everybody than if they had told the truth. The common example of this is say a murder comes to your door and asks you for your friends address so they can go kill them. Are you morally justified in lying to that person to save your friend? The answer is yes! but to Kant the answer would be no because the act of lying is bad.*

**Act Utilitarianism**: An ethical Theory whose main guiding principle is that an actions moral weight is in direct correspondence to its utility.

**Utility**: put really simply utility is the ability to produce "happiness" or prevent "unhappiness". *It should be noted that happiness and unhappiness in this case is a stand ins for good and evil. By what metrics one measures what exactly good is has always been a sticking point for utilitarian thinking.*

**Principle of Utility (Greatest happiness principle)**: An action is right (or wrong) to the extent that it increases (or decreases) the total happiness of the affected parties.

act utilitarianism is known as a **Consequentialist Philosophy** which means it is only focused around the consequences and doesn't take into account the reasoning behind the action.

Utilitarianism has two main problems. The first is that it is very vague and requires a lot of definitions in order for a person to make the necessary moral calculation like "what does happiness even mean?" and "what is a moral being". The second is that because it is a consequentialist philosophy it has no room for concepts of duty for example to a utilitarian it is more moral to donate your savings to help 10 starving kids in africa who you'll never meet than it is to spend that money to pay for your mom's cancer treatment.

**Moral Luck**: The concept that someone might undertake a good action but unknowably to them it causes a bad outcome, or someone commits an unequivocally evil action that ultimately has a good outcome.

Utilitarianism also has a problem with Moral luck because it ultimately has no room to recognize the fact that people operate on imperfect knowledge.

Most of Utilitarianism's problems can be fixed through "better moral calculus" adding into the equation things like mental health effects or recognizing that if doing an action has moral weight *X*, not doing that action doesn't mean it has moral weight *-X*.

*However these problems with Utilitarianism I think highlight the fact that it should be used more as a guiding principle for ethical decision making rather than a be all end all literal commandment from God. That is to say we all should approach ethical decision making from the point of maximizing good and then debate how we go about it rather than do these flat inhuman calculations and say "welp! them's the breaks" when it causes us to do objectively evil things*

**Propinquity**: The closeness or proximity in either space, time, or emotionally.

**Fecundity**: The ability to produce an abundance of something

***

**Rule Utilitarianism**: An ethical theory much like Act Utilitarianism but it applies the Principle of Utility to rules of conduct rather than individual actions.

**Rule Utilitarianism Principle Addendum**: Rule Utilitarians generally add an Addendum to the principle of utility. That being we should act in a way that provides the greatest amount of good to the largest number of people.

Rule Utilitarianism solves the *Moral Luck* problem and is generally more flexible than Act Utilitarianism because it can be more generalized. 

Rule Utilitarianism does have some of the same faults that act utilitarianism primarily that you can fiddle with the number in order to justify immoral actions through sound moral calculus due to the fact that you need to quantify and compare intangible things that might not be comparable. The big one is price tags on atrocities. Is there ever enough money in reparations that you can payout in order to justify mass killing? in a pure reading of both types of Utilitarianism there is.

***

**Social Contract Theory**: The Theory that members of a society implicitly agree to follow certain moral rules in order to enjoy the benefits of a society, and to live under a government strong enough to enforce these rules.

"Morality consists in the set of rules, governing how people are to treat one another, that rational people will agree to accept, for their mutual benefit, on the condition that others follow those rules as well"

**The State of Nature**: The idea that without a society to share the load we would all be living in a state of squaller taking what we need to survive by force and defending what is ours from others trying to do the same.

**Rights and Duties**: Social contract theory makes a correspondents between rights and duties. Rights are things society owes you, and duties are things you must do in order to ensure those rights. For example the *right* to life means others have a *duty* not to kill you, or the right to medicare means others have a duty to help heal you when you are ill.

**Types for Rights**:
* **Positive Rights**: A right the requires a duty that people to must do (i.e a right to free education means teachers must educate you).
* **Negative Rights**: A right that requires a duty that people must **Not** do (i.e. A right to free speech means others must not censor your speech in public).
* **Absolute Rights**: A right that must be fulfilled under any circumstances.
* **Limited Rights**: A right that maybe restricted during certain circumstances (i.e You can't yell fire in a public theater).

Social contract theory is different than Kantian theory because duties follow from rights, where kant stated that rights followed from duties

**Rawl's Theory of Justice**: Attempts to fix the problem of social contract theory, that people act selfishly and will way the contract in their favor, by proposing the following thought experiment. If a group of people were put behind the **Veil of Ignorance** and were unaware of their social classifiers (i.e. Race, Gender, Class, etc), how would the model society? Rawl's answer is that they would create 2 guiding principles:
1. Each person may claim a “fully adequate” number of basic rights and liberties, such as freedom of thought and speech, freedom of association, the right to be safe from harm, and the right to own property, so long as these claims are consistent with everyone else having a claim to the same rights and liberties.
2. Any social and economic inequalities must satisfy two conditions: first, they are associated with positions in society that everyone has a fair and equal opportunity to assume; and second, they are “to be to the greatest benefit of the least-advantaged members of society (the difference principle)”

Rawl's Theory assumes that social inequalities are just so long as the person with the most is acting in away that benefits those with the least, and that everyone in society has an equal opportunity to assume roles with more or less
***
**Virtue Ethics**: A right action is an action that a virtuous person, acting in character, would do in the same circumstances. A virtuous person is a person who possesses and lives out the virtues. The virtues are those character traits human beings need in order to flourish and be truly happy.

Virtue ethics tries to take into account the person committing the action, the action itself, and the consequences all at once by having moral wisdom trump any hard moral rule. 

This Vagueness of "in order to be a good person act the way a good person would" is simultaneously Virtue ethics strength as a ethical system and its fatal flaw. Its a strength because it is kind of human nature already to create a version of ourself we want to be and embody it, it is comforting to know that our intuition about what is right and wrong is correct and that all we need to do is "be better people". That being said it is a laughable concept that all humans intuitively know what "a good person" is, and virtue ethics really doesn't have a way for someone who doesn't know to figure out what "a good person" is. 

**Virtues**: Those character traits human beings need in order to flourish and be truly happy. Mechanically a virtue it is a habit or disposition formed the the constant repetition of a good deeds for the right reasons. Once the good deed has become second nature then it has become a virtue. It is important to note that a virtue is not just about the consequences of a good deed but the intentions as well. Good deeds done out of revenge for example aren't virtues.

It is a little bit like the christian interpretations of sins and virtues but instead of gaining points on your reward cards based on all the good actions you do, it is instead based on the good habits you have.

I a lier can tell the truth but someone with the virtue of honesty is always honest for noble reasons

**Vice**: The exact opposite of virtue. Aristotle made the observation that virtues often existed in the middle of two vices. For example the virtue of courage

## Summary

**Ethical Objectivism**: The concept that morality is a thing that exist outside the human mind and can be discovered. Basically morality is like gravity. 

**Workable Ethical Theories**: An ethical theory that one can use to make sound arguments about the morality of an action to an open minded skeptic. The Workable theories in the book are: 
* Act Utilitarianism, 
* Rule Utilitarianism,
* Kantianism, 
* Social Contract Theory, 
* Virtue Ethics.

The book claims that all of the workable moral theories (Act Utilitarianism, Rule Utilitarianism, Kantianism, Social Contract Theory, and Virtue Ethics) are all Ethical Object which I tend to take issue with!

**Unworkable Ethical Theories**: The unworkable theories are: 
* Subjective Relativism,
* Cultural Relativism,
* Divine Command Theory,
* Ethical Egoism.
