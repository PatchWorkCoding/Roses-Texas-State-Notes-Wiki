**Ethics**: The philosophical study of morality, a rational examination into people’s moral beliefs and behavior. 

**Society**: an association of people organized under a system of rules designed to advance the good of its members over time. 

**Morality**: A Society's rules of conduct describing what people ought and ought not to do in various situations.

The study of Ethics doesn't really exist without a society since their are no moral actors for you to do good or bad things to. *This of course assumes that Animals or the earth are not moral actors and that you can't do good or bad things to yourself*

The study of Ethics only applies to actions we have control over that directly relate to morals. For example pulling the leveler to choose which track trolley goes down is an ethical questions, but choosing what color that trolley is, or walking up to the podium,tripping, and accidentally pulling the lever aren't.

**Ethical Relativism**: There are no universal moral norms of right and wrong. This Theory is often divided into to different groups, *Subjective Relativism* and *Cultural relativism*

**Subjective Relativism**: There does not exist a thing called "morality" that one can measure like gravity. Instead morality is something that is created by the individual and there is no objective metric to differentiate between individual moral stances

Peoples biggest problem with subjective relativism is that it is often used as a way to shut down ethical arguments by saying "no one really knows the answer so why even argue about it." The lack of an objective metric leads to the conclusion that subjective relativism is stating that all view points are equally valid.

**Cultural Relativism**: The ethical theory that the meaning of “right” and “wrong” rests with a society’s actual moral guidelines. These guidelines vary from place to place and from time to time.

**Divine Command Theory**: Good actions are those aligned with the will of God and bad actions are those contrary to the will of God.

**Ethical Egoism**: The morally right action for a person to take in a particular situation is the action that will provide that person with the maximum long-term benefit.

**Kantianism**:
