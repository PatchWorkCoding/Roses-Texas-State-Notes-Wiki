## Malware

A piece of self replicating software designed to fill up your entire computer with junk in order to crash the system.

Some times it is designed to replicate itself across a network

Often very simple programs

Need to beware of fake antivirus software 

Windows is the most vulnerable because of its wide adoption and standardized construction

### Worm
* Self contained program designed to spread through the network by "crawling"
* Spreads through a computer network by exploiting security holes it can find autonomously

Worms are a lot less OS dependant than Viruses because they explore networks not computers

Another way malware may be downloaded without user's permision

### Drive-By Downloads
Not going to go over this in depth

Most malware downloads come from free Websites or free

They encrypt your files and won't unencrypt them unless you pay a fine

most ransomware comes from human error
