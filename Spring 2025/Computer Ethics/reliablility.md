# Chapter 8: Computer Reliability

There is an assumption that computers are completely rational devices. That they are perfectly mathematical machines whose faults stem from bugs or sicknesses, things one cannot control.

However computers aren't perfect machines, they are devices working off of thought patterns we taught them. The fai

Software Engineering is very different than other Engineering disciplines because we don't have a board of ethics or a licensing. There is no punishment for breaking the ethical standards in the computer science field

Holy fucking shit! Why is this being brought up on week fucking 10? this should be the first class. 

I am so mad right now, we will never discuss this again, and we will only touch on concepts around this.

Why the fuck I am taking this class if we aren't going to focus on ethos and rational behind ethics in software. Who is culpable when a computer system is at fault, who should be held accountable. Idk maybe a crazy fucking idea but what if we had an ethical standard a little higher than Oh if it isn't illegal I should be free to do it.

## Simulations (What can be done to decrease Error Rates)

Simulations are better than physical experiments.

## Verification vs Validation

**Verification**: Does the program correctly implement the model, are we building it correctly

**Validation**: does the model accurately represent the real system? are we building the right thing
