    * Reported directly to the king

* 18th Centruy
* No prior restraints

1st Amendment to U.S. constitution:
* Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of te peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievances


Freedom of expression is not an absolute right
* 1st amendment covers political and nonpolitical speech
* right to freed of  expressing must be balanced against the public good

Basically the first amendment is curtailed in order to keep people safe or free from power. Can't insight a riot through your speech, and you can't defame somebody, and you can't swear and advertise cigarets on the radio
