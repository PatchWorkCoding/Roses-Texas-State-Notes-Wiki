## How do we respond to and critique work?
From chapter 1 of the text book

Here are three questions to ask of the work:
1. what is it?
2. how is it put together?
    * technical, material, formal elements and principles
    *  how do the parts relate to the whole?
3. how does it stimulate our senses?
4. BONUS: what does the work mean?

Critique is generally for yourself and not for the person you are sending it to

Be specific and don't use words that are lazy

Also look for the "wonder in the art"

## Formal Analysis / Formal Criticism
Formal criticism applies no external conditions or information. We analyze the artwork just as we find it:
* painting -> look only within the frame
* play -> analyze only what we see and hear

Formal criticism is about what in the piece makes us feel the way we do

Formal criticism is about just describing what you see and how it makes you feel. like what about it draws that out of you

## Contextual Criticism
Seeks meaning by adding to the formal criticism an examination of related information outside the work. 

Most context won't be included in the art critiques 

## Value judgement
is ths thing good or bad, why?

OMG READ THE FUCKIN TEXT BOOK!!

## Art critique 1
When writing the critiques write something that is new to you! 

500 - 750 word max
It should be extremely narrow and specific, no need for plot summaries
