* Exposition - All the background information that contextualizes the actions in the script
* Complication - the inciting incident. A series for crisis, the meat of the play.
* Foreshadowing - an omen of what is to come
* Discover - the revelation of information
* Reversal - A king looses his status while a present rises in the ranks
