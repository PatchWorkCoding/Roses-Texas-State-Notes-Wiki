## Chapter 3: Opener

Openers are Important because if you are boring right out the gate the then people won't want to read on, and those who are forced to read on won't be charitable to what you have to say.

**Front Door Approach**: This is where you start with what you think and why you think it and then after that proceed to establish context.

*Good openers show the reader that the author knows what they are talking about and they have something to say. That confidence captures the readers attention either through intrigue or anger, but attention none the less*

**Back Door Approach**: This where you start with context, slowly over time build up your argument out of the component pieces. 

*This approach is less effective because it lets the author get away with not having a clear thesis statement. This practice hurts both the author and the work because it forces the author to spin their wheels writing about nothing, which is honestly worse than not having written anything at all because it wastes the reader time.*

The Back Door opener seems like a good approach because we are under the false impression that we are trying to teach our readers about a given subject rather than our readers seeking us out because they already know about the subject and want to read what like minded people have to say

**Tips to Write a Good Opener**:
1. Make sure you have a good Thesis! One way to do this is by siting down and writing "I Contend that..." and then filling in the blanks. Then re-read what you have written and treat it like you are someone who doesn't want to read it. Does it engage you or do you want to tune it out?
2. If you are having false starts, take a step back, a deep breath, and just *talk* it. Don't write it or try and make content out of it, just speak it as if you are talking to a friend over coffee
3. If you are having trouble with it, just skip it and come back later, discover your thesis in the first draft and then rewrite the paragraph
4. Talk simply and naturally. You are having a conversation with your reader, not a monologue in the globe
5. Keep it concise, not to long not to short, just somewhere in the middle
6. open with a dramatic sentence, a hot take
7. Organize your opener so that the big punch line (your thesis comes at the end)

## Chapter 7: Readability

The greatest impacts on readability are honest and naturalness. Does it feel like you are talking to a real person without the imperfections sandblasted off? is there texture or do they read like add copy? are they vulnerable enough to be open with you?

It is easy to fall into the trap of formalism, but don't do it! sandblasting your personality is boring as shit and will only kill your writing

When you write you are choosing who you want to be. Do you want to be someone who rights boring ass papers?
