**Ranking**: the act of taking a work and compressing all its dimension down into one single holistic number.

**Evaluating**: Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of a piece and coming to a conclusion of its value. This process leaves room for different criteria in which to judge goodness

Ranking tends to be the surface level reaction to most things. An "I like this more than this other thing" kind of reaction, whereas evaluating tends to take longer as you stew over what you liked and didn't like.

Ranking also doesn't work cause you can give the same paper to 30 professor and get 31 different scores
