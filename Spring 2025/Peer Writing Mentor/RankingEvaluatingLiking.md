# Evaluation vs Ranking (Why Evaluation is Good):

**Ranking**: the act of taking a work and compressing all its dimension down into one single holistic number.

**Evaluating**: Looking at the strengths and weaknesses of a piece and coming to a conclusion of its value. This process leaves room for different criteria in which to judge goodness

Ranking tends to be the surface level reaction to most things. An "I like this more than this other thing" kind of reaction, whereas evaluating tends to take longer as you stew over what you liked and didn't like.

Ranking also doesn't work cause you can give the same paper to 30 professor and get 31 different scores

Evaluating is generally a better metric for analyzing performance because Ranking collapses all the nuances of a given topic into a single number. A 78% on a paper doesn't tell you anything except that you can continue taking the class. Evaluation on the other hand is a series of comments on a paper pointing out exactly what is and isn't working

A way to implement evaluation into practice in environments where ranking must be done, such as the general schooling system that demands final grades from teacher, is through the use of Portfolios where a given student is allowed to collect their best work from the semester into one complete package and hand it off to a professor for evaluation.

An informal mid semester portfolio is a good idea so that a student can figure out where they stand in the class thus far.

Another suggestion the author gives is to add H's (Honors) and U's (Unsatisfactory) to particular student papers. These aren't "Grades" in the traditional sense as they don't appear on every paper for every student, but they do act as a reward or correction measurement for students who fall above or below the ideal boundaries.

The author also makes the point that Ranks have mor consensus around what is the "Best" and "Worst" paper. It is easy to quantify papers that are almost perfect except for XYZ and papers that are trash except for XYZ that. The problem appears in the grey area where a paper is kinda good and kinda bad that see most inconsistences from different professors around grading. One person's little complaint is another person's major hangup, and one person's kinda cool idea is another person's only redeeming quality.

This idea of a binary grading system Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory can be applied to final grade evaluation. Because really all the student wants to know is "did I pass or fail this class, and why?". A 78% for a lot of subjects only answers half of that students question. Which is bad because it doesn't give any real direction for how to get better except "raise your writing ability by 12%".

If you want to motivate students it is much better to get their writing in front of their peers rather than for you to black box grade them because in the real world there are no grades for your work, you just have to publish something and hope it isn't shit, or more accurately you have to publish something and then figure out how to make it better which is way harder than making something not shit

The author also talks about how they dissuade student anxieties by giving them a bare minimum list that will normally result in a B-. *I can see the reasoning the author had put behind this idea but I personally prefer Ron's comment of if you feel like you have put in 90% of the effort you will get a 90% in the class. Because really what we are trying to teach writers is how and where to put effort and attention. Anyone can write really well, very few of the concepts we teach are really that hard to understand, but the reason for bad papers I would argue is either about not giving enough of shit or giving a shit in the wrong places.*

*Giving a shit in this context is that part of your brain that goes I don't like this I should spend the time and effort to figure out why and correct it. Its that part of your brain that looks at the dishes in the sink and goes "okay we should do something about that rather than scroll youtube".*

# The Limitations of Evaluations:

Evaluations in excess is bad because students will become afraid of being wrong and so won't participate unless they know what the answer is. This means they never really develop the ability to judge quality and won't be able to work out their bad habits. 

Another explanations is that students aren't afraid of being judged but instead they want to be evaluated to much, or more accurately they want to be told they are doing a good job to the point where they don't take any chances or make any new discovers that will improve their thinking

*One of the important lessons a student should walk away with is the ability to evaluate their own work. A teachers job is to eventually become obsolete and only worth listening to if the student finds them worth listening to. When a student graduates they should no longer implicitly care about what you are saying, or more accurately should be able to bring up when you are wrong.*

This means we need spaces where evaluation is put on hold. The best ways the author has found to do this is by holding quick writes, and sketch writes. quicks writes are writing with no pauses for a certain length of time, and sketch writes are rough first drafts. Whenever this happen the main highlights and take ways that are bought up are on the things a student did that really work, and the professor asks the students to make those highlights themselves rather than have the professor do it for them. 

*This I think is good as it developes good taste and judgement, and lets the student figure play with writing. In other words it lets them figure out the mechanics of writing kinesthetically.*

# Liking:
You should like everything you write because to like something is to be invested in it.

The author dissuades the old myth that "we hate our writing and so revise it to be good", and instead points out that the real story is more "we hate our writing but like something in it and want to make it better!"

Good writers get better because they find people who like what they read even if it isn't good. As a teacher your role should be to like what your students write and want to see their ideas get better

If you like something it is easier to criticize it.

*Well when you put it like that it seems obvious! If you hate reading something why would you continue to do it? Only through liking does criticism not become a slog.*

From the book:
* It's not improvement that leads to liking, but rather liking that leads to improvement.
* It's the mark of good writers to like their writing.
* Liking is not same as evaluating. We can often criticize something better when we like it.
* We learn to like our writing when we have a respected reader who likes it. 
* Therefore, it's the mark of good teachers to like students and their writing.

Rather than pointing out where in a paper someone is **missing** something, instead direct there attention to where they **have** something done correctly.

"This paper is bad because it lacks organization. You have good organization over here, study and tell me why. How could those concepts apply to the rest of the paper?"

# Rose's personal thoughts:
I like this paper, and my only complaint with it is that I wish the author had treated the student body and their behavior with more systemic approach. That their was more curiosity as to why the students behave this way and why evaluation, non-evaluation, and liking corrected this behavior. A more problem and solution style of organization, rather than a loose collection of observation that dove tail at the end into a broader picture. Although I am a student who wants to learn how to better engage and learn material where this is a paper written for teachers about teaching. I imagine this organization of "hey look at these things I tried here was the result" is more relatable to teacher because it shows how easy it is to implement these changes.
