A LiFo queue. Last in First out

Stacks basic operations:
* Push - adds an item to the stack
* Pop - removes an item from the stack. (In C++ the value of the item is **not** returned)
* Peek - returns the value at the top of the stack
* empty - returns true if the stack is empty and false otherwise
* size - returns how large the size is

typedef is an obsolete feature

int foo() const; <- means that the function cannot modify any data. All functions are pointers to parts of memory in C++ *at lest I think that is the case.*
