# Recursion
**Definition**: recursion is a problem solving paradigm. It is a way of looking at a larger problem and then breaking it down into easier problems that can be understood and implemented.

**Recursion** can be a property of both **Algorithms** and **Data structures**. Examples:
* Algorithms - the fibonacci sequence
* Data structure - Linked list because it is self similar on many levels, Trees are another example

One advantage of recursion is that it is human readable

The big disadvantage is that recursion can take up a lot of space on the stack

Important factors to determine for the recursive function:
* Size Factor -
* base case(s) - Where does the recursion stop. When does the function return something other than itself
* general case(s) - what does the function do and where the does the function call itself
* exit condition -
