# Recursion
**Definition**: recursion is a problem solving paradigm. It is a way of looking at a larger problem and then breaking it down into easier problems that can be understood and implemented.

**Recursion** can be a property of both **Algorithms** and **Data structures**. Examples:
* Algorithms - the fibonacci sequence
* Data structure - Linked list because it is self similar on many levels, Trees are another example

One advantage of recursion is that it is human readable
